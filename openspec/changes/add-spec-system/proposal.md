# Change: Establish OpenSpec system and initial capability specs

## Why
The app is a multi-target macOS container platform with complex workflows. We need a spec-driven system for scoping, prioritization, and testable requirements before large feature work begins.

## What Changes
- Create OpenSpec change proposal, tasks, and design for the spec system.
- Add initial capability specs based on OrbStack docs and project requirements.
- Define project context and conventions in `openspec/project.md` (pending approval).
- Establish task/spec tracking flow for containerization-first milestones.

## Impact
- Affected specs: New capabilities under `openspec/specs/` after approval.
- Affected code: `openspec/` only.
