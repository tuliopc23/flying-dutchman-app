# Flying Dutchman

**macOS Tahoe-only, Apple Silicon-only containerization management.**

Flying Dutchman is a local-first development tool providing first-class integration with Apple's native
Containerization framework. Built entirely in Swift 6.2, Flying Dutchman delivers an "it just works"
experience inspired by Orbstack—fast, intuitive, and native to macOS.

## Vision

- **Platform**: macOS 15.0+ (Tahoe), Apple Silicon only
- **Architecture**: 100% Swift 6.2 (app, engine, CLI)
- **Philosophy**: Local-first development, not enterprise infrastructure
- **Experience**: Zero-config defaults, guided workflows, ⌘K command palette
- **Integration**: Docker API compatibility, Kubernetes, AI agents via pluggable layers

See `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for complete project principles and governance.

## Status

🚧 **Early Development** - Constitution ratified, MVP planning in progress.
