## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutput#overview)
[`AVCapturePhotoOutput`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutput) provides an interface for capture workflows related to still photography. In addition to basic capture of still images, a photo output supports RAW-format capture, bracketed capture of multiple images, Live Photos, and wide-gamut color. You can output captured photos in a variety of formats and codecs, including RAW format DNG files, HEVC format HEIF files, and JPEG files.
To capture photos with the [`AVCapturePhotoOutput`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutput) class, follow these steps:
  1. Create an [`AVCapturePhotoOutput`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutput) object. Use its properties to determine supported capture settings and to enable certain features (for example, whether to capture Live Photos).
  2. Create and configure an [`AVCapturePhotoSettings`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotosettings) object to choose features and settings for a specific capture (for example, whether to enable image stabilization or flash).
  3. Capture an image by passing your photo settings object to the [`capturePhoto(with:delegate:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutput/capturephoto\(with:delegate:\)) method along with a delegate object implementing the [`AVCapturePhotoCaptureDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotocapturedelegate) protocol. The photo capture output then calls your delegate to notify you of significant events during the capture process.


Some photo capture settings, such as the [`flashMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotosettings/flashmode) property, include options for automatic behavior. For such settings, the photo output determines whether to use that feature at the moment of capture—you don’t know when requesting a capture whether the feature will be enabled when the capture completes. When the photo capture output calls your [`AVCapturePhotoCaptureDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotocapturedelegate) methods with information about the completed or in-progress capture, it also provides an [`AVCaptureResolvedPhotoSettings`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcaptureresolvedphotosettings) object that details which automatic features are set for that capture. The resolved settings object’s [`uniqueID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcaptureresolvedphotosettings/uniqueid) property matches the [`uniqueID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotosettings/uniqueid) value of the [`AVCapturePhotoSettings`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotosettings) object you used to request capture.
Enabling certain photo features (Live Photo capture and high resolution capture) requires a reconfiguration of the capture render pipeline. To opt into these features, set the [`isHighResolutionCaptureEnabled`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutput/ishighresolutioncaptureenabled), [`isLivePhotoCaptureEnabled`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutput/islivephotocaptureenabled), and [`isLivePhotoAutoTrimmingEnabled`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutput/islivephotoautotrimmingenabled) properties before calling your [`AVCaptureSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturesession) object’s [`startRunning()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturesession/startrunning\(\)) method. Changing any of these properties while the session is running disrupts the capture render pipeline: Live Photo captures in progress end immediately, unfulfilled photo requests abort, and video preview temporarily freezes.
Using a photo capture output adds other requirements to your [`AVCaptureSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturesession) object:
  * A capture session can’t support both Live Photo capture and movie file output. If your capture session includes an [`AVCaptureMovieFileOutput`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturemoviefileoutput) object, the [`isLivePhotoCaptureSupported`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutput/islivephotocapturesupported) property becomes [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/false). (As an alternative, you can use the [`AVCaptureVideoDataOutput`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturevideodataoutput) class to output video buffers at the same resolution as a simultaneous Live Photo capture).
  * A capture session can’t contain both an [`AVCapturePhotoOutput`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutput) object and an [`AVCaptureStillImageOutput`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturestillimageoutput) object. The [`AVCapturePhotoOutput`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutput) class includes all functionality of (and deprecates) the [`AVCaptureStillImageOutput`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturestillimageoutput) class.


The [`AVCapturePhotoOutput`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutput) class implicitly supports wide-gamut color photography. If the source [`AVCaptureDevice`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice) object’s [`activeColorSpace`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice/activecolorspace) value is [`AVCaptureColorSpace.P3_D65`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturecolorspace/p3_d65), the capture output produces photos with wide color information (unless your [`AVCapturePhotoSettings`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotosettings) object specifies an output format that doesn’t support wide color).
