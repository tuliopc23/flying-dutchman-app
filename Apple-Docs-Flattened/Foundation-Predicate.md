Structure
# Predicate
A logical condition used to test a set of input values for searching or filtering.
iOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+Mac Catalyst 17.0+macOS 14.0+tvOS 17.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 10.0+
```
struct Predicate<each Input>
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/Predicate#overview)
A predicate is a logical condition that evaluates to a Boolean value (true or false). You use predicates for operations like filtering a collection or searching for matching elements.
To create a predicate, use the `Predicate(_:)` macro. For example:
```
let messagePredicate = #Predicate<Message> { message in
    message.length < 100 && message.sender == "Jeremy"
}

```

In the example above, the closure that contains the predicate’s conditions takes one argument — the value being tested. Even though you write the predicate using a closure, the macro transforms that closure into a predicate when you compile. The code in the closure isn’t run as part of your program.
In the predicate’s definition, you can use the following operations:
  * Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
  * Unary minus (`-`)
  * Range (`...`, `..<`)
  * Comparison (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`)
  * Ternary conditional (`?:`)
  * Conditional expressions
  * Boolean logic (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
  * Swift optionals (`?`, `??`, `!`, `flatMap(_:)`, `if`-`let` expressions)
  * Types (`as`, `as?`, `as!`, `is`)
  * Sequence operations (`allSatisfy()`, `filter()`, `contains()`, `contains(where:)`, `starts(with:)`, `max()`, `min()`)
  * Subscript and member access (`[]`, `.`)
  * String comparisons (`contains(_:)`, `localizedStandardContains(_:)`, `caseInsensitiveCompare(_:)`, `localizedCompare(_:)`)


A predicate can’t contain any nested declarations, use any flow control such as `for` loops, or modify variables from its enclosing scope. However, it can refer to constants that are in scope.
To express more complex queries, you can nest expressions in the predicate:
```
let messagePredicate = #Predicate<Message> { message in
    message.recipients.contains {
        $0.firstName == message.sender.firstName
    }
}

```

You can safely encode and decode predicates, pass predicates across concurrency boundaries, and load a predicate from a file. To define a list of types and key paths that are allowed when reading an archived predicate, use [`PredicateCodableConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/predicatecodableconfiguration).
You can transform a predicate into another representation — for example, to express a predicate in another query language, or to create a modified predicate — using the [`expression`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/predicate/expression) property.
