iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 14.0+tvOS 17.0+
```
class let currentExposureTargetBias: [Float](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Float)
```

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVFoundation/AVCaptureDevice/currentExposureTargetBias#Discussion)
Pass this value to the [`setExposureTargetBias(_:completionHandler:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice/setexposuretargetbias\(_:completionhandler:\)) method to lock exposure bias to its current value, which disables autoexposure.
