Instance Method
# applicationDidFinishLaunching(_:)
Tells the delegate that the app’s initialization is complete but it hasn’t received its first event.
macOS 10.10+
```
@[MainActor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/MainActor)
optional func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ notification: [Notification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/Notification))
```

## [ Parameters ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplicationdelegate/applicationdidfinishlaunching\(_:\)#parameters) 

`notification`
    
A notification named [`didFinishLaunchingNotification`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/didfinishlaunchingnotification). Calling the [`object`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSNotification/object) method of this notification returns the `NSApplication` object itself.
## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplicationdelegate/applicationdidfinishlaunching\(_:\)#Discussion)
Delegates can implement this method to perform further initialization. This method is called after the application’s main run loop has been started but before it has processed any events. If the application was launched by the user opening a file, the delegate’s [`application(_:openFile:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplicationdelegate/application\(_:openfile:\)) method is called before this method. If you want to perform initialization before any files are opened, implement the [`applicationWillFinishLaunching(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplicationdelegate/applicationwillfinishlaunching\(_:\)) method in your delegate, which is called before [`application(_:openFile:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplicationdelegate/application\(_:openfile:\)).)
