## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/armeshclassification#overview)
When you enable [`sceneReconstruction`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arworldtrackingconfiguration/scenereconstruction) on a world-tracking configuration, ARKit provides several mesh anchors ([`ARMeshAnchor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/armeshanchor)) that collectively estimate the shape of the physical environment. Within that model of the real world, ARKit may identify specific objects, like seats, windows, tables, or walls. ARKit shares that information by exposing one or more [`ARMeshClassification`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/armeshclassification) instances in a mesh’s [`geometry`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/armeshanchor/geometry) property.
For a sample app that demonstrates mesh classification, see [Visualizing and interacting with a reconstructed scene](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/visualizing-and-interacting-with-a-reconstructed-scene).
