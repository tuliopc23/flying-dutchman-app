# NSPlaceholders
A set of methods that an object can implement to register default placeholders to be displayed for a binding, when no other placeholder is specified.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsplaceholders#overview)
Individual placeholder values can be specified for each of the marker objects (described in [Selection Markers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/selection-markers)), as well as when the property is `nil`.
Placeholders are used when a property of an instance of the receiving class is accessed through a key value coding compliant method, and returns `nil` or a specialized marker.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsplaceholders#topics)
### [Managing default placeholders](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsplaceholders#Managing-default-placeholders)
[`class func setDefaultPlaceholder(Any?, for: Any?, with: NSBindingName)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ObjectiveC/NSObject-swift.class/setDefaultPlaceholder\(_:for:with:\))
Sets `placeholder` as the default placeholder for the `binding`, when a key value coding compliant property of an instance of the receiving class returns the value specified by `marker`, and no other placeholder has been specified.
[`class func defaultPlaceholder(for: Any?, with: NSBindingName) -> Any?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ObjectiveC/NSObject-swift.class/defaultPlaceholder\(for:with:\))
Returns an object that will be used as the placeholder for the `binding`, when a key value coding compliant property of an instance of the receiving class returns the value specified by `marker`, and no other placeholder has been specified.
### [Constants](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsplaceholders#Constants)
[API Reference Selection Markers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/selection-markers)
The following constants are used to describe special cases for a controller’s selection.
