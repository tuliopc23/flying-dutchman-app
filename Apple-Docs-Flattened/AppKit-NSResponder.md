Class
# NSResponder
An abstract class that forms the basis of event and command processing in AppKit.
macOS
```
@[MainActor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/MainActor)
class NSResponder
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder#overview)
The core classes—[`NSApplication`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication), [`NSWindow`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow), and [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview)—inherit from [`NSResponder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder), as must any class that handles events. The responder model uses three components: event messages, action messages, and the responder chain.
[`NSResponder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder) also plays an important role in the presentation of error information. The default implementations of the [`presentError(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/presenterror\(_:\)) and [`presentError(_:modalFor:delegate:didPresent:contextInfo:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/presenterror\(_:modalfor:delegate:didpresent:contextinfo:\)) methods send [`willPresentError(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/willpresenterror\(_:\)) to `self`, thereby giving subclasses the opportunity to customize the localized information presented in error alerts. `NSResponder` then forwards the message to the next responder, passing it the customized [`NSError`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSError) object. The exact path up the modified responder chain depends on the type of application window:
  * Window that the document owns: view > superviews > window > window controller > document object > document controller > the application object
  * Window with window controller but no documents: view > superviews > window > window controller > the application object
  * Window with no window controllers: view > superviews > window > the application object


[`NSApplication`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication) displays a document-modal error alert and, if the error object has a recovery attempter, gives it a chance to recover from the error. A recovery attempter is an object that conforms to the [NSErrorRecoveryAttempting](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/nserrorrecoveryattempting) informal protocol.
Note
In macOS 10.15 and later, [`NSResponder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder) and its descendants call the [`dealloc`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ObjectiveC/NSObject-swift.class/dealloc) method on the main thread. This method helps to avoid situations where an asynchronous block unexpectedly deallocates an object on a background queue.
