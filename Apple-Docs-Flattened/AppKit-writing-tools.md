# Writing Tools
Add support for Writing Tools to your app’s text views.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/writing-tools#overview)
Writing Tools provides a simple way for people to improve what they write using your app. Text views that support Writing Tools gain the ability to proofread, rewrite, summarize, or compose content with the help of system-provided large language models (LLMs) and Apple Intelligence.
Writing Tools supports both the standard system views and custom text views you create. The [`NSTextView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstextview) and [`NSTextField`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstextfield) classes automatically support Writing Tools, but you can customize that support to suit your app’s requirements. You can also add Writing Tools support to any [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) in your app that contains text.
