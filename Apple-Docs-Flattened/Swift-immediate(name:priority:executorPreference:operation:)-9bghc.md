Type Method
# immediate(name:priority:executorPreference:operation:)
Create and immediately start running a new detached task in the context of the calling thread/task.

```
@discardableResult
static func immediate(
    name: [String](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string)? = nil,
    priority: [TaskPriority](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/taskpriority)? = nil,
    executorPreference taskExecutor: consuming (any [TaskExecutor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/taskexecutor))? = nil,
    operation: sending @escaping @isolated(any) () async throws -> Success
) -> [Task](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/task)<Success, any [Error](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/error)>
```

Available when `Success` conforms to `Sendable` and `Failure` is `any Error`.
## [ Parameters ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Task/immediate\(name:priority:executorPreference:operation:\)-9bghc#parameters) 

`name`
    
The high-level human-readable name given for this task 

`priority`
    
The priority of the task. Pass `nil` to use the [`basePriority`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/task/basepriority) of the current task (if there is one). 

`taskExecutor`
    
The task executor that the child task should be started on and keep using. Explicitly passing `nil` as the executor preference is equivalent to no preference, and effectively means to inherit the outer context’s executor preference. You can also pass the [`globalConcurrentExecutor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/globalconcurrentexecutor) global executor explicitly. 

`operation`
    
The operation to be run immediately upon entering the task.
## [Return Value](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Task/immediate\(name:priority:executorPreference:operation:\)-9bghc#return-value)
A reference to the unstructured task which may be awaited on.
## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Task/immediate\(name:priority:executorPreference:operation:\)-9bghc#discussion)
This function _starts_ the created task on the calling context. The task will continue executing on the caller’s context until it suspends, and after suspension will resume on the adequate executor. For a nonisolated operation this means running on the global concurrent pool, and on an isolated operation it means the appropriate executor of that isolation context.
As indicated by the lack of `async` on this method, this method does _not_ suspend, and instead takes over the calling task’s (thread’s) execution in a synchronous manner.
Other than the execution semantics discussed above, the created task is semantically equivalent to a task created using the `Task/init` initializer.
