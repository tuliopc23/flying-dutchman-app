# TN3185: Troubleshooting In-App Purchases availability in Xcode
Inspect your active StoreKit configuration file for unexpected configurations.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3185-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-xcode#Overview)
When using [StoreKit Testing in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode) to test your In-App Purchases, your app may not display its products. StoreKit Testing in Xcode is a local test environment for testing In-App Purchases without requiring a connection to App Store servers. To set up testing in this environment, add a local or synced StoreKit configuration file that contains In-App Purchases to your Xcode project. For more information, see [Create a StoreKit configuration file](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode#Create-a-StoreKit-configuration-file). When you [enable a configuration file](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode#Enable-StoreKit-Testing-in-Xcode) in your Xcode project, this file becomes active. StoreKit uses data saved in the active configuration file when your app calls StoreKit APIs in the test environment. For more information, see [Setting up StoreKit Testing in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode).
To offer In-App Purchases in your app, call [`Product.products(for:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product/products\(for:\)) with a list of [product identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/in-app-purchase-information) (`Product ID`) matching these products in the test environment. `Product.products(for:)` returns an array that includes an instance of [`Product`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product) for each of the In-App Purchases. Update your app’s UI with these returned instances, which contain all In-App Purchase information set up in the active configuration file for your app.
If `Product.products(for:)` fails to return a Product instance for your In-App Purchases, it may be due to the following reasons:
  * Your In-App Purchases are missing or don’t exist in the active StoreKit configuration file.
  * You set up the test environment to simulate a load products failure scenario.


Note
If your app fails to display its products when testing In-App Purchases in the Apple sandbox environment, or when launching the app in the App Store, see [TN3186: Troubleshooting In-App Purchases availability in the sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3186-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-the-sandbox) and [TN3188: Troubleshooting In-App Purchases availability in the App Store](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3188-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-the-app-store), respectively.
## [Validate your product identifier list](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3185-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-xcode#Validate-your-product-identifier-list)
Inspect the active StoreKit configuration file in your Xcode project. Confirm each product identifier in your list matches the product identifier of an In-App Purchase configured in this file.
## [Disable the Simulated StoreKit Load Products failure setting](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3185-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-xcode#Disable-the-Simulated-StoreKit-Load-Products-failure-setting)
A [StoreKit configuration file](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode#Create-a-StoreKit-configuration-file) includes settings you can use to specify test conditions or scenarios for your In-App Purchases such as Load Products. When you enable Load Products, the test environment simulates the load product failure scenario you specified such as network error. Calling [`Product.products(for:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product/products\(for:\)) in your app throws a [StoreKit error](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/StoreKitError). When you disable this setting, the function returns all your In-App Purchases that exist in the active configuration file. For more information, see [Change settings and initiate test conditions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/testing-in-app-purchases-with-storeKit-transaction-manager-in-code#Change-settings-and-initiate-test-conditions) in [Testing in-app purchases with StoreKit transaction manager in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/testing-in-app-purchases-with-storeKit-transaction-manager-in-code).
To prevent the test environment from simulating a load products failure scenario, perform these steps in your Xcode project:
  1. In the Project navigator, select your active StoreKit configuration file.
  2. Click Configuration Settings.
  3. Scroll down to Simulated StoreKit Failures.
  4. Disable the Load Products setting.
