Sample Code
# Ranging for Beacons
Configure a device to act as a beacon and to detect surrounding beacons.
[ Download ](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/d7d2b5ab19c1/RangingForBeacons.zip)
iOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+Xcode 11.2+
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreLocation/ranging-for-beacons#Overview)
Beacons make location-based products and services available to users by broadcasting information to your device. Ranging is the process of reading the characteristics of a beacon region, such as signal strength, advertising interval, and measured power.
This sample code project configures a device to act as a beacon, and configures a device to use ranging to find surrounding beacons. Use two iOS devices to run the sample, with one acting as a beacon, and the other ranging for the beacon.
Note
This project is associated with WWDC 2019 session [705: What’s New in Location](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc19/705/).
### [Configure a Device to Act as a Beacon](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreLocation/ranging-for-beacons#Configure-a-Device-to-Act-as-a-Beacon)
Run the sample app on the first iOS device. Select the option to Configure a Beacon. The project hardcodes a default value for the UUID that can be changed in `ConfigureBeaconViewController.swift`.
```
let beaconUUID = UUID(uuidString: "E2C56DB5-DFFB-48D2-B060-D0F5A71096E0")

```

Optionally modify the major and minor value for the beacon, then select the Enabled switch on the configuration screen to start advertising.
`ConfigureBeaconViewController.swift` contains a view controller object that configures the iOS device running this app to act as a beacon. The `configureBeaconRegion()` method sets up the region and starts advertising itself.
```
if peripheralManager.state == .poweredOn {
    peripheralManager.stopAdvertising()
    if enabled {
        let bundleURL = Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier!
        
        // Defines the beacon identity characteristics the device broadcasts.
        let constraint = CLBeaconIdentityConstraint(uuid: beaconUUID!, major: major, minor: minor)
        region = CLBeaconRegion(beaconIdentityConstraint: constraint, identifier: bundleURL)
        
        let peripheralData = region.peripheralData(withMeasuredPower: nil) as? [String: Any]
        
        // Start broadcasting the beacon identity characteristics.
        peripheralManager.startAdvertising(peripheralData)
    }

```

### [Configure a Device to Range for Beacons](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreLocation/ranging-for-beacons#Configure-a-Device-to-Range-for-Beacons)
Using a second iOS device, run the sample app and tap Range for Beacons to scan for beacons. Add a UUID to range for by tapping the Add button in the upper corner of the screen. The hardcoded UUID appears by default.
`RangeBeaconViewController.swift` contains a view controller object that ranges a set of beacon regions that the user adds. As in any location-based service, first request authorization. Use a `CLLocationManager` instance to request that authorization, set up the constraint based on the hardcoded UUID, then tell the instance to start monitoring.
```
self.locationManager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()


// Create a new constraint and add it to the dictionary.
let constraint = CLBeaconIdentityConstraint(uuid: uuid)
self.beaconConstraints[constraint] = []


/*
By monitoring for the beacon before ranging, the app is more
energy efficient if the beacon is not immediately observable.
*/
let beaconRegion = CLBeaconRegion(beaconIdentityConstraint: constraint, identifier: uuid.uuidString)
self.locationManager.startMonitoring(for: beaconRegion)

```

When the device enters the specified region, the `locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didDetermineState state: CLRegionState, for region: CLRegion)` delegate method receives the region state and starts ranging beacons.
While one or more beacons are in range, the `locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didRange beacons: [CLBeacon], satisfying beaconConstraint: CLBeaconIdentityConstraint)` delegate method receives their characteristics in the passed array.
