## [ Mentioned in ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity/iseligibleforpublicindexing#mentions)
[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/creating-a-user-activity-object)
## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity/iseligibleforpublicindexing#Discussion)
The default value of this property is [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/false), which indicates that the activity object contains private or sensitive information or that the activity isn’t useful to other users. When the value of this property is [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/true), the system identifies this activity as one that can be shared publicly. When you make an activity public, the system indexes the values in the [`requiredUserInfoKeys`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity/requireduserinfokeys) or [`webpageURL`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity/webpageurl) properties, and you must provide a value for one of those properties.
Identifying an activity as public confers an advantage when you also add web markup to the content on your related website. Specifically, when users engage with your app’s public activities in search results, it indicates to Apple that public information on your website is popular, which can help increase your ranking and potentially lead to expanded indexing of your website’s content.
