## [ Mentioned in ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/URL/cachesDirectory#mentions)
[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/using-the-file-system-effectively)
## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/URL/cachesDirectory#Discussion)
In iOS, this directory is within the app’s sandbox directory. In macOS, it’s within the app’s sandbox directory for sandboxed apps, or in the current user’s home directory `(~/Library/Caches)` if the app isn’t sandboxed.
This computed property is equivalent to calling [`NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(_:_:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nssearchpathfordirectoriesindomains\(_:_:_:\)) with the [`FileManager.SearchPathDirectory.cachesDirectory`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filemanager/searchpathdirectory/cachesdirectory) parameter.
