# DNS proxy provider
Create an on-device DNS proxy using a custom protocol.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/dns-proxy-provider#overview)
A DNS proxy provider is an app extension that implements DNS proxying. You should create a DNS proxy provider if you want to take responsibility for resolving all DNS queries on the system. Typically this involves forwarding the queries in a way that improves performance, reliability or security. For example, a DNS proxy provider might:
  * Forward DNS queries to a well-known Internet-wide DNS server
  * Talk to a DNS proxying service using DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT)
  * Implement a completely custom DNS proxying protocol


For detailed information about DNS proxy provider deployment options, see [TN3134: Network Extension provider deployment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Technotes/tn3134-network-extension-provider-deployment).
