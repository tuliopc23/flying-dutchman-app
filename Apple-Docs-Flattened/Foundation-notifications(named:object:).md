Instance Method
# notifications(named:object:)
Returns an asynchronous sequence of notifications produced by this center for a given notification name and optional source object.
iOS 15.0+iPadOS 15.0+Mac Catalyst 15.0+macOS 12.0+tvOS 15.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 8.0+
```
@preconcurrency
func notifications(
    named name: [Notification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notification).[Name](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notification/name-swift.typealias),
    object: (any [AnyObject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/AnyObject) & [Sendable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Sendable))? = nil
) -> [NotificationCenter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notificationcenter).[Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notificationcenter/notifications)
```

## [ Parameters ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NotificationCenter/notifications\(named:object:\)#parameters) 

`name`
    
A notification name. The sequence includes only notifications with this name. 

`object`
    
A source object of notifications. Specify a sender object to deliver only notifications from that sender. When `nil`, the notification center doesn’t consider the sender as a criteria for delivery.
## [Return Value](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NotificationCenter/notifications\(named:object:\)#return-value)
An asynchronous sequence of notifications from the center.
## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NotificationCenter/notifications\(named:object:\)#Discussion)
Use this method to receive notifications from the center as an [`AsyncSequence`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/AsyncSequence). You iterate over this sequence with `for`-`await`-`in` syntax.
[`Notification`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notification) doesn’t conform to [`Sendable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Sendable), because several of its members can’t be sendable, such as [`object`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notification/object) and the [`userInfo`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notification/userinfo) dictionary. If you iterate over the notifications in this sequence, Xcode issues a warning about crossing an actor boundary. To handle this, use a `NotificationCenter/Notifications/map(_:)-3wc5j` or `NotificationCenter/Notifications/compactMap(_:)-6wlbd` to extract sendable properties of the notification, such as its [`name`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notification/name-swift.property) or sendable values from the [`userInfo`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notification/userinfo) dictionary.
The following macOS example calls [`notifications(named:object:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notificationcenter/notifications\(named:object:\)) to receive an asynchronous sequence of [`didActivateApplicationNotification`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSWorkspace/didActivateApplicationNotification) notifications from the shared [`NSWorkspace`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSWorkspace) notification center. It then uses a `NotificationCenter/Notifications/compactMap(_:)-6wlbd` to retrieve [`NSRunningApplication`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSRunningApplication) values from the notification’s [`userInfo`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notification/userinfo) dictionary, from which it gets [`localizedName`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSRunningApplication/localizedName) strings. Since the [`String`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/String) type conforms to [`Sendable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Sendable), you can iterate over this type without a compiler warning.
```
for await appName in NSWorkspace.shared.notificationCenter.notifications (
    named: NSWorkspace.didActivateApplicationNotification)
    .compactMap ({ notification in
        guard let appInfo = notification.userInfo?[NSWorkspace.applicationUserInfoKey] as? NSRunningApplication,
              let name = appInfo.localizedName else { return nil as String? }
        return name
    })
{
    print("Application activated: \(appName)")
}

```
