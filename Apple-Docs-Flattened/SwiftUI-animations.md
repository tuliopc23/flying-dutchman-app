# Animations
Create smooth visual updates in response to state changes.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Animations#Overview)
You tell SwiftUI how to draw your app’s user interface for different states, and then rely on SwiftUI to make interface updates when the state changes.
![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/634da5b7eb74a20fee434a105cebd3c7/animations-hero%402x.png)
To avoid abrupt visual transitions when the state changes, add animation in one of the following ways:
  * Animate all of the visual changes for a state change by changing the state inside a call to the [`withAnimation(_:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/withanimation\(_:_:\)) global function.
  * Add animation to a particular view when a specific value changes by applying the [`animation(_:value:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/animation\(_:value:\)) view modifier to the view.
  * Animate changes to a [`Binding`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding) by using the binding’s [`animation(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding/animation\(_:\)) method.


SwiftUI animates the effects that many built-in view modifiers produce, like those that set a scale or opacity value. You can animate other values by making your custom views conform to the [`Animatable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animatable) protocol, and telling SwiftUI about the value you want to animate.
When an animated state change results in adding or removing a view to or from the view hierarchy, you can tell SwiftUI how to transition the view into or out of place using built-in transitions that [`AnyTransition`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/anytransition) defines, like [`slide`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/anytransition/slide) or [`scale`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/anytransition/scale). You can also create custom transitions.
For design guidance, see [Motion](https://developer.apple.com/design/Human-Interface-Guidelines/motion) in the Human Interface Guidelines.
