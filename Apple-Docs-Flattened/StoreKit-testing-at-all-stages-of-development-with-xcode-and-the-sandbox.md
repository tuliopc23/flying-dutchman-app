# Testing at all stages of development with Xcode and the sandbox
Verify your implementation of In-App Purchases by testing your code throughout its development.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/testing-at-all-stages-of-development-with-xcode-and-the-sandbox#overview)
Use the Apple sandbox and Xcode test environments to test your implementation of in-app purchases using the StoreKit framework. Comprehensive testing can help you:
  * Ensure a seamless purchase flow to provide a positive customer experience in your app.
  * Implement sound logic that covers all scenarios, such as purchases, restores, and subscription offers.
  * Validate that purchases behave correctly in production after your app is available in the App Store.


The tools you need to test in-app purchases, non-renewing subscriptions, and auto-renewable subscriptions from early development through beta testing are: 

StoreKit Testing in Xcode
    
For early development, continuous integration, and debugging. For more information, see [StoreKit Test](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKitTest). 

Sandbox
    
For testing scenarios using in-app purchase data you set up in App Store Connect. For more information, see [Testing In-App Purchases with sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/testing-in-app-purchases-with-sandbox). 

TestFlight
    
For managing beta testing with internal and external testers. TestFlight uses a beta build of your app or App Clip that you upload to App Store Connect. For more information, see [Beta Testing Made Simple with TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/).
Choose the tools that support the test scenarios you need. Make sure you’re able to perform the setup required for the tools you choose.
During the early stages of development, you may not be ready to configure in-app purchases in App Store Connect. StoreKit Testing in Xcode lets you configure the information locally. You can test StoreKit transactions before you create Sandbox Apple Accounts, without a network connection. You can test your app in Simulator or on real devices.
After you set up in-app purchases in App Store Connect, start using the sandbox environment to test the product information your app will use in production. Testing in the sandbox lets you test transactions from end-to-end and from your app to your server. You can also test any server-to-server functionalities your app depends on, such as transaction validation and [App Store Server Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppStoreServerNotifications).
TestFlight lets you get feedback from members of your team or from external testers. TestFlight uses the sandbox environment for in-app purchases. Transactions and purchases that occur in the sandbox don’t incur charges. The following table compares the test environments and features:
Test environment | Requires App Store Connect setup | Provides receipts and JSON Web Signature (JWS) transactions signed by the App Store | Provides subscription renewal information signed by the App Store  
---|---|---|---  
StoreKit Testing in Xcode | No | No (signed by Xcode) | No (signed by Xcode)  
Sandbox | Yes | Yes | Yes  
TestFlight (uses the sandbox) | Yes | Yes | Yes  
None of the test environments charge users when they test buying a product. The App Store doesn’t send emails for purchases or refunds made in the test environments.
### [Control the test environment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/testing-at-all-stages-of-development-with-xcode-and-the-sandbox#Control-the-test-environment)
To set up and run test scenarios, you often need to control the test environment. For example, you may want to reset a test account to rerun the same test multiple times, or mimic actions users take outside your app that affect the test conditions. The following table shows the capabilities each tool has to control the test environment:
Test scenario | Sandbox | StoreKit Testing in Xcode  
---|---|---  
Test different storefronts to affect price tiers and locale | Yes | Limited (no price tiers)  
Clear the purchase history | Yes | Yes  
Test subscription upgrades, downgrades, cross-grades, and auto-renew cancellations | Yes | Yes  
Reset eligibility for introductory offers | Yes | Yes  
Introduce forced StoreKit errors for testing | No | Yes  
Speed up or slow down the rate of time for testing subscription renewals | Yes | Yes  
For more information about speeding up renewal periods for testing, see [Test in-app purchases](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/test-in-app-purchases-main/test-in-app-purchases).
### [Test common StoreKit scenarios](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/testing-at-all-stages-of-development-with-xcode-and-the-sandbox#Test-common-StoreKit-scenarios)
All apps that offer in-app purchases need to support restoring purchases, displaying in-app purchases to the customer, and handling basic transactions. The following table lists common test scenarios and whether they’re testable in the sandbox or Xcode:
Test scenario | Sandbox | StoreKit Testing in Xcode  
---|---|---  
Restore purchases | Yes | Yes  
Finish a transaction with [`finish()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/finish\(\)) or [`finishTransaction(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymentqueue/finishtransaction\(_:\)) | Yes | Yes  
Buy a consumable or non-consumable in-app purchase | Yes | Yes  
Repurchase a non-consumable purchase for repeated testing | Yes | Yes  
Purchase an auto-renewable subscription | Yes | Yes  
Purchase a non-renewing subscription | Yes | Yes  
Refund an in-app purchase | Yes | Yes  
Test an interrupted purchase, where the user must complete actions outside the app | Yes | Yes  
Test a failed purchase attempt when payment authorization fails | Yes | Yes  
Retrieve configured in-app purchases from App Store Connect | Yes | Yes (optionally); can also retrieve data from a StoreKit configuration file  
Manage subscriptions within your app with [`showManageSubscriptions(in:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/appstore/showmanagesubscriptions\(in:\)) and [`manageSubscriptionsSheet(isPresented:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/manageSubscriptionsSheet\(isPresented:\)) | Yes | Yes  
Initiate a refund request. For more information, see [Testing refund requests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/testing-refund-requests). | Yes | Yes  
### [Test subscriptions and Ask to Buy](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/testing-at-all-stages-of-development-with-xcode-and-the-sandbox#Test-subscriptions-and-Ask-to-Buy)
Depending on the in-app purchases your app offers, you may need to test scenarios that involve auto-renewing subscriptions, introductory offers, promotional offers, and Ask to Buy. The following table lists test scenarios and whether they’re testable in the sandbox or Xcode:
Test scenario | Sandbox | StoreKit Testing in Xcode  
---|---|---  
Initiate an Ask to Buy transaction that results in a deferred state | Yes | Yes  
Resolve an Ask to Buy transaction by approving or rejecting it | No | Yes  
Redeem an introductory offer for an auto-renewable subscription | Yes | Yes  
Redeem a promotional offer for an auto-renewable subscription | Yes | Yes  
Redeem an offer code | No | Yes  
Process a subscription renewal | Yes | Yes  
Process a revoked or refunded subscription | Yes | Yes  
Respond to a customer canceling a subscription and disabling auto-renew | Yes | Yes  
Respond to an expired subscription | Yes | Yes  
Process a subscription upgrade or downgrade | Yes | Yes  
Process a subscription cross-grade with the same or different duration | Yes | Yes  
Test a price increase for an auto-renewable subscription | No | Yes  
Test billing retry and billing grace period | Yes | Yes  
For more information, see [Approve what kids buy with Ask to Buy](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201089) and [Testing introductory offers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/testing-introductory-offers).
