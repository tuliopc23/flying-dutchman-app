## [ Mentioned in ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/promotioninfo#mentions)
[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/supporting-promoted-in-app-purchases-in-your-app)
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/promotioninfo#overview)
The `Product.PromotionInfo` structure represents promoted in-app purchases available in your app. You set up promoted in-app purchases using App Store Connect, including their default display order and visibility settings. Use this API to override and customize their order and visibility. Overrides are per device. They can take effect after the user launches the app at least once.
You don’t instantiate this structure. To get a list of `Product.PromotionInfo` objects, call the static method [`updateProductOrder(byID:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/promotioninfo/updateproductorder\(byid:\)) with a list of product identifiers that represent your promoted in-app purchases. Then call [`currentOrder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/promotioninfo/currentorder) to get the list of `Product.PromotionInfo` objects. To change their order, call [`updateAll(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/promotioninfo/updateall\(_:\)) with the promoted in-app purchases listed in the desired order. To change the order using product identifiers, call [`updateProductOrder(byID:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/promotioninfo/updateproductorder\(byid:\)).
To prevent a promoted in-app purchase from appearing in the App Store on the device, there are two options:
  * Hide the product by setting the [`visibility`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/promotioninfo/visibility-swift.property) value to [`Product.PromotionInfo.Visibility.hidden`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/promotioninfo/visibility-swift.enum/hidden) and calling [`update()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/promotioninfo/update\(\)), or call [`updateProductVisibility(_:for:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/promotioninfo/updateproductvisibility\(_:for:\)).
  * Remove the product from the list by excluding it when you call [`updateAll(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/promotioninfo/updateall\(_:\)) or [`updateProductOrder(byID:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/promotioninfo/updateproductorder\(byid:\)).


To cancel your overrides and return to the default order and visibility, call [`updateAll(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/promotioninfo/updateall\(_:\)) or [`updateProductOrder(byID:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/promotioninfo/updateproductorder\(byid:\)) with an empty array.
