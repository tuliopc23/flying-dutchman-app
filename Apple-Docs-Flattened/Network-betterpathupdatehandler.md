## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwconnection/betterpathupdatehandler#Discussion)
Better path events are an indication that a more preferable network path is available. If you can migrate your work to a new connection, try establishing a new connection. Once that new connection is ready, cancel the original connection.
