# Queries
Query health and fitness data.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/queries#overview)
Use queries to read sample data from the HealthKit store. You can also use queries to list all the sources for a particular data type, or to perform statistical calculations for a data type. For example, statistical queries can calculate the minimum and maximum heart rate for a given week, or the total step count for a given day.
You run a query by calling the HealthKit store’s [`execute(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkhealthstore/execute\(_:\)) method. HealthKit returns a snapshot of the current results to the query’s results handler. Long-running queries continue to monitor the HealthKit store, and return any relevant changes to the query’s update handler. To return sorted or filtered results, give the query a sort descriptor or predicate.
