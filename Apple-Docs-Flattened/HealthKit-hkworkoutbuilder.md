# HKWorkoutBuilder
A builder object that incrementally constructs a workout.
iOS 12.0+iPadOS 12.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOSvisionOS 1.0+watchOS 5.0+
```
class HKWorkoutBuilder
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutbuilder#overview)
Incrementally collect samples and events associated with a workout. When the workout ends, call [`finishWorkout(completion:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutbuilder/finishworkout\(completion:\)) to create an [`HKWorkout`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkout) sample and save it to the HealthKit store.
For watchOS, use an [`HKWorkoutSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutsession) and an [`HKLiveWorkoutBuilder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkliveworkoutbuilder) instead.
