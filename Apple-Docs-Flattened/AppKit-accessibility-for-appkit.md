# Accessibility for AppKit
Make your AppKit apps accessible to everyone who uses macOS.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/accessibility-for-appkit#overview)
Making your app accessible means making it usable by everyone. By designing your app with accessibility in mind, you make it possible for everyone to enjoy your app. For more information, see [Accessibility](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Accessibility).
AppKit controls and views come with built-in accessibility, providing an accessible user experience by default. Typically, you don’t need to do extra work to enable the standard accessibility features.
In some cases, you might want to modify the default values to better represent your app, to provide additional context, or to modify the user’s flow through the app. AppKit makes these customizations straightforward, involving a few lines of code or Interface Builder adjustments as you define your user interface. For more information about customizing accessibility for AppKit elements, see [`NSAccessibilityProtocol`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsaccessibilityprotocol).
If your app contains custom user interface elements that subclass [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview), enhance the accessibility of those elements using the role-based protocols in [Custom Controls](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/custom-controls). If your app contains custom user interface elements that don’t inherit from [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) or one of the other AppKit classes with built-in accessibility, make those elements accessible by subclassing [`NSAccessibilityElement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsaccessibilityelement-swift.class).
If you build your app with SwiftUI, see [Accessibility modifiers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View-Accessibility).
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/accessibility-for-appkit#topics)
### [Essentials](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/accessibility-for-appkit#Essentials)
[Integrating accessibility into your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Accessibility/integrating-accessibility-into-your-app)
Make your app more accessible to users with disabilities by adding accessibility features.
[Accessibility design for Mac Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Accessibility/accessibility_design_for_mac_catalyst)
Improve navigation in your app by using keyboard shortcuts and accessibility containers.
### [AppKit Elements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/accessibility-for-appkit#AppKit-Elements)
If you’re using a standard AppKit user interface element, you can override its existing accessibility attributes or use it as-is.
[`protocol NSAccessibilityProtocol`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsaccessibilityprotocol)
The complete list of properties and methods for accessible elements.
[`struct NSAccessibility`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsaccessibility-swift.struct)
A namespace for accessibility symbols for AppKit apps.
### [Custom View Subclasses](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/accessibility-for-appkit#Custom-View-Subclasses)
If you’re subclassing an AppKit view to create a custom user interface element, you can adopt one or more role-specific protocols to enhance that element’s accessibility.

### [Custom Elements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/accessibility-for-appkit#Custom-Elements)
If you’re designing a completely custom user interface element that doesn’t subclass an AppKit view, you must subclass the accessibility element class.
[`class NSAccessibilityElement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsaccessibilityelement-swift.class)
The basic infrastructure necessary for interacting with an assistive app.
