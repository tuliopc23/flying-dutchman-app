# Animation
The way a view changes over time to create a smooth visual transition from one state to another.

## [ Mentioned in ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation#mentions)
[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/unifying-your-app-s-animations)
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation#overview)
An `Animation` provides a visual transition of a view when a state value changes from one value to another. The characteristics of this transition vary according to the animation type. For instance, a [`linear`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/linear) animation provides a mechanical feel to the animation because its speed is consistent from start to finish. In contrast, an animation that uses easing, like [`easeOut`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/easeout), offers a more natural feel by varying the acceleration of the animation.
To apply an animation to a view, add the [`animation(_:value:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/animation\(_:value:\)) modifier, and specify both an animation type and the value to animate. For instance, the [`Circle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/circle) view in the following code performs an [`easeIn`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/easein) animation each time the state variable `scale` changes:
```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var scale = 0.5


    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Circle()
                .scaleEffect(scale)
                .animation(.easeIn, value: scale)
            HStack {
                Button("+") { scale += 0.1 }
                Button("-") { scale -= 0.1 }
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }

```

[ Play ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation)
When the value of `scale` changes, the modifier [`scaleEffect(_:anchor:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/scaleeffect\(_:anchor:\)) resizes [`Circle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/circle) according to the new value. SwiftUI can animate the transition between sizes because [`Circle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/circle) conforms to the [`Shape`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/shape) protocol. Shapes in SwiftUI conform to the [`Animatable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animatable) protocol, which describes how to animate a property of a view.
In addition to adding an animation to a view, you can also configure the animation by applying animation modifiers to the animation type. For example, you can:
  * Delay the start of the animation by using the [`delay(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/delay\(_:\)) modifier.
  * Repeat the animation by using the [`repeatCount(_:autoreverses:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/repeatcount\(_:autoreverses:\)) or [`repeatForever(autoreverses:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/repeatforever\(autoreverses:\)) modifiers.
  * Change the speed of the animation by using the [`speed(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/speed\(_:\)) modifier.


For example, the [`Circle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/circle) view in the following code repeats the [`easeIn`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/easein) animation three times by using the [`repeatCount(_:autoreverses:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/repeatcount\(_:autoreverses:\)) modifier:
```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var scale = 0.5


    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Circle()
                .scaleEffect(scale)
                .animation(.easeIn.repeatCount(3), value: scale)
            HStack {
                Button("+") { scale += 0.1 }
                Button("-") { scale -= 0.1 }
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

```

Content description: A video that shows a circle that repeats the ease-in animation three times: enlarging, then shrinking, then enlarging again. The animation reverses causing the circle to shrink, then enlarge, then shrink to its original size. 
[ Play ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation)
A view can also perform an animation when a binding value changes. To specify the animation type on a binding, call its [`animation(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding/animation\(_:\)) method. For example, the view in the following code performs a [`linear`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/linear) animation, moving the box truck between the leading and trailing edges of the view. The truck moves each time a person clicks the [`Toggle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/toggle) control, which changes the value of the `$isTrailing` binding.
```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isTrailing = false


    var body: some View {
       VStack(alignment: isTrailing ? .trailing : .leading) {
            Image(systemName: "box.truck")
                .font(.system(size: 64))


            Toggle("Move to trailing edge",
                   isOn: $isTrailing.animation(.linear))
        }
    }
}

```
