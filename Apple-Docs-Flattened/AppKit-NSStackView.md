Class
# NSStackView
A view that arranges an array of views horizontally or vertically and updates their placement and sizing when the window size changes.
macOS 10.9+
```
@[MainActor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/MainActor)
class NSStackView
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstackview#overview)
A stack view employs Auto Layout (the system’s constraint-based layout feature) to arrange and align an array of views according to your specification. To use a stack view effectively, you need to understand the basics of Auto Layout constraints as described in [Auto Layout Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853).
### [Basic Features of Stack Views](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstackview#Basic-Features-of-Stack-Views)
A stack view supports vertical and horizontal layouts and interacts dynamically with window resizing and Cocoa animations. You can easily reconfigure the contents of a stack view at runtime. That is, after you create and configure a stack view in Interface Builder, you can add or remove views dynamically without explicitly working with layout constraints. For example, if you configure a stack view with three checkboxes and dynamically add a fourth, the stack view automatically adds constraints as needed, according to the stack view’s configuration. The new checkbox gains dynamic layout configuration from the stack view.
Stack views are nestable: a stack view is a valid element in the [`views`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstackview/views) array of another stack view.
Important
Do not add views or constraints to a stack view’s private views. A stack view’s private views might change in future versions of macOS and are not guaranteed to be encoded or decoded with the [`NSCoder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSCoder) class.
For more information on [`NSStackView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstackview), see [Organize Your User Interface with a Stack View](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/organize-your-user-interface-with-a-stack-view).
### [Layout Direction and Gravity Areas](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstackview#Layout-Direction-and-Gravity-Areas)
A stack view has three so-called _gravity areas_ that each identify a section of the stack view’s layout. A horizontal stack view, which is the default type, has a leading, a center, and a trailing gravity area. The ordering of these areas depends on the value of the stack view’s [`userInterfaceLayoutDirection`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/userinterfacelayoutdirection) property (inherited from the [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) class). In a left to right language, the leading gravity area in a horizontal stack view is on the left. To enforce a left to right layout independently of language, explicitly set the layout direction by calling the inherited [`userInterfaceLayoutDirection`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/userinterfacelayoutdirection) method on your stack view instance.
To specify vertical layout, use the [`orientation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstackview/orientation) property and the [`NSUserInterfaceLayoutOrientation.vertical`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsuserinterfacelayoutorientation/vertical) constant from the [`NSUserInterfaceLayoutOrientation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsuserinterfacelayoutorientation) enumeration. In a vertical stack view, the gravity areas always are top, center, and bottom.
### [View Detachment and Hiding](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstackview#View-Detachment-and-Hiding)
A stack view can automatically detach and reattach its views in response to layout changes, such as window resizing performed by the user, or resizing/repositioning of another view in the same view hierarchy. A view in a detached state is not present in the stack view’s view hierarchy, but it still consumes memory. A view that is hidden, but not detached, remains part of the view hierarchy and continues to participate in Auto Layout, but it is not visible and doesn’t receive input events.
To allow views to detach, set the so-called _clipping resistance_ for a stack view to a value lower than its default of [`required`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nslayoutconstraint/priority-swift.struct/required). See the [`setClippingResistancePriority(_:for:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstackview/setclippingresistancepriority\(_:for:\)) method.
You can influence which views detach first (and reattach last). Do this by setting the so-called _visibility priority_ for each view whose detachment order you want to specify. A view with a lower visibility priority detaches before one with a higher priority, and reattaches after it. See the [`NSStackView.VisibilityPriority`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstackview/visibilitypriority) enumeration and the [`setVisibilityPriority(_:for:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstackview/setvisibilitypriority\(_:for:\)) method.
To explicitly detach a view from a stack view, call the [`setVisibilityPriority(_:for:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstackview/setvisibilitypriority\(_:for:\)) method with a value of [`notVisible`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstackview/visibilitypriority/notvisible). To explicitly reattach a view to a stack view, call the same method with a value of [`mustHold`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstackview/visibilitypriority/musthold). If you hide a view that belongs to a stack view (by setting the view’s [`isHidden`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/ishidden) property to [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/true)), the view detaches from the stack view by default. Use the [`detachesHiddenViews`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstackview/detacheshiddenviews) property to change the default behavior.
The system calls a stack view delegate method when a view is about to be detached and when a view has been reattached, giving you the opportunity to run code at those times. See [`NSStackViewDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstackviewdelegate).
