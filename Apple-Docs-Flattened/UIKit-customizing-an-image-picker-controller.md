Sample Code
# Customizing an image picker controller
Manage user interactions and present custom information when taking pictures by adding an overlay view to your image picker.
[ Download ](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/8a225e1270c0/CustomizingAnImagePickerController.zip)
iOS 10.0+iPadOS 10.0+Xcode 11.0+
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/customizing-an-image-picker-controller#Overview)
This sample applies an overlay view to display a custom view hierarchy on top of the default image picker interface.
The sample app uses an overlay view to:
  * Create an interface to respond to user input.
  * Display custom information (such as images to enhance the interface).
  * Implement a number of unique camera functions such as single picture capture, timed picture capture, and repeated pictures like a camera with a fast shutter speed.


### [Configure the sample code project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/customizing-an-image-picker-controller#Configure-the-sample-code-project)
Because the camera isn’t available in Simulator, you’ll need to build and run this sample on a device with iOS 10 or later installed.
When you first launch the sample app on device, you’ll need to grant the app permission to use the camera.
### [Set up the overlay view](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/customizing-an-image-picker-controller#Set-up-the-overlay-view)
The sample app uses the [`cameraOverlayView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/cameraoverlayview) property to provide an overlay view that contains the custom view hierarchy. The image picker places the custom overlay view on top of the other image picker views.
```
/*
Apply the overlay view. This view contains a toolbar with custom
controls for capturing still images in various ways.
*/
overlayView?.frame = (imagePickerController.cameraOverlayView?.frame)!
imagePickerController.cameraOverlayView = overlayView

```

An app can access the [`cameraOverlayView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/cameraoverlayview) property only when the source type of the image picker is set to `UIImagePickerController.SourceType.camera`.
When the user interacts with interface elements in the custom view, the app calls an image picker method such as [`takePicture()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/takepicture\(\)) to capture a photo, and implement other features. This sample’s custom image picker controller interface provides the following features:
  * Take a Picture
  * Take a Delayed Picture
  * Take Repeated Pictures
  * Browse Media in the Photo Library


The [`showsCameraControls`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/showscameracontrols) property indicates whether the image picker displays the default camera controls. The [`showsCameraControls`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/showscameracontrols) property is only accessible when the source type of the image picker is `UIImagePickerController.SourceType.camera`. This sample sets [`showsCameraControls`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/showscameracontrols) to `false` to hide the default controls and provide a custom overlay view.
```
if sourceType == UIImagePickerController.SourceType.camera {
	/*
	 The user tapped the camera button in the app's interface which
	 specifies the device’s built-in camera as the source for the image
	 picker controller.
	*/


	/*
	 Hide the default controls.
	 This sample provides its own custom controls for still image
	 capture in an overlay view.
	*/
	imagePickerController.showsCameraControls = false


	/*
	 Apply the overlay view. This view contains a toolbar with custom
	 controls for capturing still images in various ways.
	*/
	overlayView?.frame = (imagePickerController.cameraOverlayView?.frame)!
	imagePickerController.cameraOverlayView = overlayView
}

```

### [Take a picture](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/customizing-an-image-picker-controller#Take-a-picture)
Take a picture with the Snap button. Its action method calls the [`takePicture()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/takepicture\(\)) method to actually take a picture.
```
@IBAction func takePhoto(_ sender: UIBarButtonItem) {
imagePickerController.takePicture()
}

```

### [Take a delayed picture](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/customizing-an-image-picker-controller#Take-a-delayed-picture)
Take a picture after a short delay with the Delayed button. Its action method calls the [`takePicture()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/takepicture\(\)) method to take a picture when the timer expires.
```
@IBAction func delayedTakePhoto(_ sender: UIBarButtonItem) {
	/*
	 Disable the photo controls during the delay time period.
	 The code in the timer completion block below captures a still image
	 when the delay period expires and re-enables the controls.
	*/
	doneButton?.isEnabled = false
	takePictureButton?.isEnabled = false
	delayedPhotoButton?.isEnabled = false
	startStopButton?.isEnabled = false
	
	let fireDate = Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 5)
	cameraTimer = Timer(fire: fireDate, interval: 1.0, repeats: false, block: { timer in
		// The time interval expired. Capture a still image.
		self.imagePickerController.takePicture()


		// Enable the delayed photos controls.
		self.doneButton?.isEnabled = true
		self.takePictureButton?.isEnabled = true
		self.delayedPhotoButton?.isEnabled = true
		self.startStopButton?.isEnabled = true
	})
	RunLoop.main.add(cameraTimer, forMode: RunLoop.Mode.default)
}

```

### [Take repeated pictures](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/customizing-an-image-picker-controller#Take-repeated-pictures)
Take repeated pictures at a certain interval with the Start button; for example, one photo every five seconds. Its action method creates a timer to take pictures at certain intervals using the [`takePicture()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/takepicture\(\)) method.
This sample takes pictures indefinitely, causing it to run out of memory quickly. You must decide upon a proper threshold of the number of captured photos for your own app (for simplicity, this app does not enforce a limit). To avoid memory constraints, save each taken photo to disk rather than keeping all of the pictures in memory. The system may invoke your app’s [`didReceiveMemoryWarning()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/didreceivememorywarning\(\)) method in low memory situations so the app can recover some memory and continue taking photos.
```
@IBAction func startTakingPicturesAtIntervals(_ sender: UIBarButtonItem) {
	// Start the timer to take a photo every 5 seconds.


	startStopButton?.title = NSLocalizedString("Stop", comment: "Title for overlay view controller start/stop button")
	startStopButton?.action = #selector(stopTakingPicturesAtIntervals)
	
	// Enable these buttons while capturing photos.
	doneButton?.isEnabled = false
	delayedPhotoButton?.isEnabled = false
	takePictureButton?.isEnabled = false


	// Start taking pictures.
	cameraTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 5, repeats: true) { timer in
		self.imagePickerController.takePicture()
	}
}

```

The camera starts taking pictures as soon as the user taps the Start button (which changes to a Stop button). The camera continues to capture photos until the user taps Stop. Captured images appear in the order taken within the app’s image view.
```
@IBAction func stopTakingPicturesAtIntervals(_ sender: UIBarButtonItem) {
	// Stop and reset the timer.
	cameraTimer.invalidate()


	finishAndUpdate()
	
	// Make these buttons available again.
	self.doneButton?.isEnabled = true
	self.takePictureButton?.isEnabled = true
	self.delayedPhotoButton?.isEnabled = true
	
	// Reset the button to start taking pictures again.
	startStopButton?.title = NSLocalizedString("Start", comment: "Title for overlay view controller start/stop button")
	startStopButton?.action = #selector(startTakingPicturesAtIntervals)
}

```

### [Browse media in the Photo Library](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/customizing-an-image-picker-controller#Browse-media-in-the-Photo-Library)
To browse images saved in the photo albums on the device, add a button that the user can press to go to their Photo Library. The button’s action method configures the picker for browsing saved media by setting its [`sourceType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/sourcetype-swift.property) property to `UIImagePickerController.SourceType.photoLibrary`, before presenting the picker’s media browser user interface.
```
@IBAction func showImagePickerForPhotoPicker(_ sender: UIBarButtonItem) {
showImagePicker(sourceType: UIImagePickerController.SourceType.photoLibrary, button: sender)
}

```

Selecting a photo invokes the app’s [`imagePickerController(_:didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontrollerdelegate/imagepickercontroller\(_:didfinishpickingmediawithinfo:\)) delegate method which saves the selected image to an array and displays it in the app’s image view.
Tapping the Cancel button invokes the app’s [`imagePickerControllerDidCancel(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontrollerdelegate/imagepickercontrollerdidcancel\(_:\)) delegate method which calls [`dismiss(animated:completion:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/dismiss\(animated:completion:\)) to dismiss the picker.
