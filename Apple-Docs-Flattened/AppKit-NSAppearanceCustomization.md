Protocol
# NSAppearanceCustomization
A set of methods for getting and setting the appearance attributes of a view.
macOS
```
protocol NSAppearanceCustomization : [NSObjectProtocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ObjectiveC/NSObjectProtocol)
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsappearancecustomization#overview)
When an object adopts this protocol, assigning a value to the [`appearance`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsappearancecustomization/appearance) property causes that object to use the appearance attributes you specified instead of any inherited attributes. You can access the current attributes for the object from the [`effectiveAppearance`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsappearancecustomization/effectiveappearance) property, which reflects any inherited attributes.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsappearancecustomization#topics)
### [Getting and Setting Appearance](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsappearancecustomization#Getting-and-Setting-Appearance)
[Choosing a Specific Appearance for Your macOS App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/choosing-a-specific-appearance-for-your-macos-app)
Adopt a specific appearance for your windows, views, or app when it is inappropriate to support both light and dark variants.
[`var appearance: NSAppearance?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsappearancecustomization/appearance)
The appearance of the receiver, in an `NSAppearance` object.
