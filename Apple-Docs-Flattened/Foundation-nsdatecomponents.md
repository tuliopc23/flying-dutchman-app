Class
# NSDateComponents
An object that specifies a date or time in terms of units (such as year, month, day, hour, and minute) to be evaluated in a calendar system and time zone.
iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+
```
class NSDateComponents
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatecomponents#overview)
In Swift, this object bridges to [`DateComponents`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents); use [`NSDateComponents`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatecomponents) when you need reference semantics or other Foundation-specific behavior.
[`NSDateComponents`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatecomponents) encapsulates the components of a date in an extendable, object-oriented manner. It’s used to specify a date by providing the temporal components that make up a date and time: hour, minutes, seconds, day, month, year, and so on. You can also use it to specify a duration of time, for example, 5 hours and 16 minutes. An [`NSDateComponents`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatecomponents) object is not required to define all the component fields. When a new instance of [`NSDateComponents`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatecomponents) is created, the date components are set to [`NSDateComponentUndefined`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatecomponentundefined).
Important
An [`NSDateComponents`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatecomponents) object is meaningless in itself; you need to know what calendar it is interpreted against, and you need to know whether the values are absolute values of the units, or quantities of the units.
An instance of [`NSDateComponents`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatecomponents) is not responsible for answering questions about a date beyond the information with which it was initialized. For example, if you initialize one with May 4, 2017, its weekday is [`NSDateComponentUndefined`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatecomponentundefined), not Thursday. To get the correct day of the week, you must create a suitable instance of [`NSCalendar`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscalendar), create an [`NSDate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdate) object using [`date(from:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscalendar/date\(from:\)) and then use [`components(_:from:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscalendar/components\(_:from:\)) to retrieve the weekday—as illustrated in the following example.
  * [ Swift ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatecomponents)
  * [ Objective-C ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatecomponents)


```
let dateComponents = NSDateComponents()
dateComponents.day = 4
dateComponents.month = 5
dateComponents.year = 2017


if let gregorianCalendar = NSCalendar(calendarIdentifier: .gregorian),
    let date = gregorianCalendar.date(from: dateComponents as DateComponents) {
    let weekday = gregorianCalendar.component(.weekday, from: date)
    print(weekday) // 5, which corresponds to Thursday in the Gregorian Calendar
}



```

```
NSDateComponents *dateComponents = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];
dateComponents.day = 4;
dateComponents.month = 5;
dateComponents.year = 2017;
 
NSCalendar *gregorianCalendar = [[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier:NSCalendarIdentifierGregorian];
NSDate *date = [gregorianCalendar dateFromComponents:dateComponents];
 
NSInteger weekday = [gregorianCalendar component:NSCalendarUnitWeekday fromDate:date];
NSLog(@"%d", weekday); // 5, which corresponds to Thursday in the Gregorian Calendar

```

Important
The Swift overlay to the Foundation framework provides the [`DateComponents`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents) structure, which bridges to the [`NSDateComponents`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatecomponents) class. For more information about value types, see [Working with Cocoa Frameworks](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/WorkingWithCocoaDataTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH6) in [Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C (Swift 4.1)](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216).
