## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsbindingoption#Discussion)
Values that are used as keys in the options dictionary passed to the [`bind(_:to:withKeyPath:options:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ObjectiveC/NSObject-swift.class/bind\(_:to:withKeyPath:options:\)) method.
These keys are also used in the dictionary returned as the [`options`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsbindinginfokey/options) value of [`infoForBinding(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ObjectiveC/NSObject-swift.class/infoForBinding\(_:\)). See the [Cocoa Bindings Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/CocoaBindingsRef/CocoaBindingsRef.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000189i) for more information.
