Class
# ARMeshAnchor
An anchor for a physical object that ARKit detects and recreates virtually using a polygonal mesh.
iOS 13.4+iPadOS 13.4+Mac Catalyst 13.4+
```
class ARMeshAnchor
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/armeshanchor#overview)
ARKit subdivides the reconstructed, real-world scene surrounding the user into mesh anchors.
Mesh anchors constantly update their data as ARKit refines its understanding of the real world. Although ARKit updates a mesh to reflect a change in the physical environment (such as when a person pulls out a chair), the mesh’s subsequent change is not intended to reflect in real time.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/armeshanchor#topics)
### [Accessing the Mesh](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/armeshanchor#Accessing-the-Mesh)
[`var geometry: ARMeshGeometry`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/armeshanchor/geometry)
3D information about the mesh such as its shape and classifications.
[`class ARMeshGeometry`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/armeshgeometry)
Mesh information stored in an efficient, array-based format.
