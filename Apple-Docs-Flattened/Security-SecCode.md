## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/SecCode#overview)
In many function calls, a value of type [`SecCode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/seccode) can be passed to a parameter that is typed as a [`SecStaticCode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/secstaticcode). In these cases, the function performs an implicit call to the [`SecCodeCopyStaticCode(_:_:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/seccodecopystaticcode\(_:_:_:\)) function and operates on the result.
