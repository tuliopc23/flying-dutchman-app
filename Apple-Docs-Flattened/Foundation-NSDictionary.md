## [ Mentioned in ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSDictionary#mentions)
[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/implementing-handoff-in-your-app)
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSDictionary#overview)
You can use this type in Swift instead of a [`Dictionary`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Dictionary) in cases that require reference semantics.
The `NSDictionary` class declares the programmatic interface to objects that manage immutable associations of keys and values. For example, an interactive form could be represented as a dictionary, with the field names as keys, corresponding to user-entered values.
Use this class or its subclass [`NSMutableDictionary`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsmutabledictionary) when you need a convenient and efficient way to retrieve data associated with an arbitrary key. `NSDictionary` creates static dictionaries, and `NSMutableDictionary` creates dynamic dictionaries. (For convenience, the term _dictionary_ refers to any instance of one of these classes without specifying its exact class membership.)
A key-value pair within a dictionary is called an entry. Each entry consists of one object that represents the key and a second object that is that key’s value. Within a dictionary, the keys are unique. That is, no two keys in a single dictionary are equal (as determined by [`isEqual(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ObjectiveC/NSObjectProtocol/isEqual\(_:\))). In general, a key can be any object (provided that it conforms to the `NSCopying` protocol—see below), but note that when using key-value coding the key must be a string (see [Accessing Object Properties](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/BasicPrinciples.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20002170)). Neither a key nor a value can be `nil`; if you need to represent a null value in a dictionary, you should use [`NSNull`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsnull).
`NSDictionary` is “toll-free bridged” with its Core Foundation counterpart, [`CFDictionary`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreFoundation/CFDictionary). See [Toll-Free Bridging](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/CocoaEncyclopedia/Toll-FreeBridgin/Toll-FreeBridgin.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010810-CH2) for more information on toll-free bridging.
### [Creating NSDictionary Objects Using Dictionary Literals](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSDictionary#Creating-NSDictionary-Objects-Using-Dictionary-Literals)
In addition to the provided initializers, such as [`init(objects:forKeys:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdictionary/init\(objects:forkeys:\)), you can create an `NSDictionary` object using a _dictionary literal_.
  * [ Swift ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSDictionary)
  * [ Objective-C ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSDictionary)


```
let dictionary: NSDictionary = [
    "anObject" : someObject,
    "helloString" : "Hello, World!",
    "magicNumber" : 42,
    "aValue" : someValue
]

```

```
NSDictionary *dictionary = @{
       @"anObject" : someObject,
    @"helloString" : @"Hello, World!",
    @"magicNumber" : @42,
         @"aValue" : someValue
};

```

In Objective-C, the compiler generates code that makes an underlying call to the [`dictionaryWithObjects:forKeys:count:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdictionary/dictionarywithobjects:forkeys:count:) method.
```
id objects[] = { someObject, @"Hello, World!", @42, someValue };
id keys[] = { @"anObject", @"helloString", @"magicNumber", @"aValue" };
NSUInteger count = sizeof(objects) / sizeof(id);
NSDictionary *dictionary = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjects:objects
                                                       forKeys:keys
                                                         count:count];

```

Unlike [`dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdictionary/dictionarywithobjectsandkeys:) and other initializers, dictionary literals specify entries in key-value order. You should not terminate the list of objects with `nil` when using this literal syntax, and in fact `nil` is an invalid value. For more information about object literals in Objective-C, see [Working with Objects](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/WorkingwithObjects/WorkingwithObjects.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210-CH4) in [Programming with Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210).
In Swift, the `NSDictionary` class conforms to the `DictionaryLiteralConvertible` protocol, which allows it to be initialized with dictionary literals. For more information about object literals in Swift, see [Literal Expression](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Expressions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH32-ID390) in [The Swift Programming Language (Swift 4.1)](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097).
### [Accessing Values Using Subscripting](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSDictionary#Accessing-Values-Using-Subscripting)
In addition to the provided instance methods, such as [`object(forKey:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdictionary/object\(forkey:\)), you can access `NSDictionary` values by their keys using _subscripting_.
  * [ Swift ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSDictionary)
  * [ Objective-C ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSDictionary)


```
let value = dictionary["helloString"]

```

```
id value = dictionary[@"helloString"];

```

### [Enumerating Entries Using for-in Loops](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSDictionary#Enumerating-Entries-Using-for-in-Loops)
In addition to the provided instance methods, such as [`enumerateKeysAndObjects(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdictionary/enumeratekeysandobjects\(_:\)), you can enumerate `NSDictionary` entries using _for-in loops_.
  * [ Swift ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSDictionary)
  * [ Objective-C ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSDictionary)


```
for (key, value) in dictionary {
    print("Value: \(value) for key: \(key)")
}

```

```
for (NSString *key in dictionary) {
    id value = dictionary[key];
    NSLog(@"Value: %@ for key: %@", value, key);
}

```

In Objective-C, `NSDictionary` conforms to the [`NSFastEnumeration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsfastenumeration) protocol.
In Swift, `NSDictionary` conforms to the `SequenceType` protocol.
### [Subclassing Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSDictionary#Subclassing-Notes)
You generally shouldn’t need to subclass `NSDictionary`. Custom behavior can usually be achieved through composition rather than subclassing.
#### [Methods to Override](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSDictionary#Methods-to-Override)
If you do need to subclass `NSDictionary`, take into account that it is a [Class cluster](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/ClassCluster.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008195-CH7). Any subclass must override the following primitive methods:
  * [`init(objects:forKeys:count:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdictionary/init\(objects:forkeys:count:\))
  * [`count`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdictionary/count)
  * [`object(forKey:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdictionary/object\(forkey:\))
  * [`keyEnumerator()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdictionary/keyenumerator\(\))


The other methods of `NSDictionary` operate by invoking one or more of these primitives. The non-primitive methods provide convenient ways of accessing multiple entries at once.
#### [Alternatives to Subclassing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSDictionary#Alternatives-to-Subclassing)
Before making a custom class of `NSDictionary`, investigate [`NSMapTable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsmaptable) and the corresponding Core Foundation type, [`CFDictionary`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreFoundation/CFDictionary). Because `NSDictionary` and `CFDictionary` are “toll-free bridged,” you can substitute a `CFDictionary` object for a `NSDictionary` object in your code (with appropriate casting). Although they are corresponding types, `CFDictionary` and `NSDictionary` do not have identical interfaces or implementations, and you can sometimes do things with `CFDictionary` that you cannot easily do with `NSDictionary`.
If the behavior you want to add supplements that of the existing class, you could write a category on `NSDictionary`. Keep in mind, however, that this category will be in effect for all instances of `NSDictionary` that you use, and this might have unintended consequences. Alternatively, you could use composition to achieve the desired behavior.
