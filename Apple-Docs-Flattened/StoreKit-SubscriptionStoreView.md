## [ Mentioned in ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/SubscriptionStoreView#mentions)
[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/merchandising-win-back-offers-in-your-app)
[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/testing-win-back-offers-in-xcode)
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/SubscriptionStoreView#overview)
A `SubscriptionStoreView` displays localized information about auto-renewable subscriptions, including their localized names, descriptions, and prices, as well as a purchase button.
Create a subscription store view by using one of the initializers and providing the following information:
  * A subscription group identifier
  * A collection of product identifiers
  * A collection of product values you previously loaded from the App Store


If you provide a subscription group identifier or a collection of product identifiers, the subscription store view automatically loads the subscription data from the App Store, and updates the view when the data is available.
### [Provide a background and a decorative icon](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/SubscriptionStoreView#Provide-a-background-and-a-decorative-icon)
The subscription store view doesn’t draw a background by default. You can add a background as follows:
  * To layer a background behind the view, use a view modifier, such as `background(alignment:content:)`.
  * To set the container background of the subscription store using a view, use the `containerBackground(_:for:)` or `containerBackground(for:alignment:content:)` view modifier and specify a [`ContainerBackgroundPlacement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/ContainerBackgroundPlacement), such as [`subscriptionStoreHeader`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/ContainerBackgroundPlacement/subscriptionStoreHeader).


You can optionally provide a view as a decorative icon next to each subscription option. Use the [`subscriptionStoreControlIcon(icon:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/subscriptionStoreControlIcon\(icon:\)) view modifier to set a view that decorates individual subscription options within a subscription store.
### [Order and filter subscriptions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/SubscriptionStoreView#Order-and-filter-subscriptions)
If you create the subscription store view by providing a subscription group identifier, the system orders the subscription options according to their rank. If the customer is already subscribed, you may want to merchandise upgrade or crossgrade options. By default, the subscription store view lists all the subscriptions in the group. To hide certain subscription options, provide the `visibleRelationships` parameter in the initializer. For more information about the visible relationships, see [`Product.SubscriptionRelationship`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/subscriptionrelationship).
If you create the subscription store view using one of the other initializers, the view orders the subscriptions according to the collection parameter’s order. The view excludes subscriptions that you don’t include in the collection parameter.
### [Add terms of service and privacy policies](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/SubscriptionStoreView#Add-terms-of-service-and-privacy-policies)
The `SubscriptionStoreView` automatically displays buttons for the terms of service and privacy policy that you submit in App Store Connect. To override the destination of these buttons with a URL to custom terms of service and privacy policy pages, or a custom view, use the modifiers [`subscriptionStorePolicyDestination(url:for:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/subscriptionStorePolicyDestination\(url:for:\)) and [`subscriptionStorePolicyDestination(for:destination:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/subscriptionStorePolicyDestination\(for:destination:\)).
Use modifiers, such as [`subscriptionStorePolicyForegroundStyle(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/subscriptionStorePolicyForegroundStyle\(_:\)), to customize the button’s style, for example, to make the text more readable against your store’s background.
### [Add auxiliary buttons](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/SubscriptionStoreView#Add-auxiliary-buttons)
You can show auxiliary buttons in the subscription store using view modifiers. Specify the button’s visibility within the subscription store by using the [`storeButton(_:for:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/storeButton\(_:for:\)) view modifier.
If you offer your subscription through other services, you can configure the subscription store view to display a sign-in button. Use the [`subscriptionStoreSignInAction(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/subscriptionStoreSignInAction\(_:\)) modifier to set the function your app calls when someone uses the sign-in button.
The subscription store view automatically shows a Close button. To override this behavior, use the `storeButton(_:for:)` modifier to unconditionally show, or hide, the Close button.
### [Style the subscription store view](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/SubscriptionStoreView#Style-the-subscription-store-view)
You can further customize the subscription store’s appearance using control styles. Use subscription store control styles to customize the display of subscription options, and how people interact with your store. To try out standard styles, such as [`PickerSubscriptionStoreControlStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/pickersubscriptionstorecontrolstyle), apply the style using the [`subscriptionStoreControlStyle(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/subscriptionStoreControlStyle\(_:\)) modifier.
