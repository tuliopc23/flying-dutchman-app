Type Property
# abDatabaseChanged
Posted when this process has changed the Address Book database.
macOS 10.0+
```
static let abDatabaseChanged: [NSNotification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsnotification).[Name](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsnotification/name-swift.struct)
```

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSNotification/Name-swift.struct/abDatabaseChanged#Discussion)
Depending on the operation performed on the address book, one or more of the following keys may be included in the user-info dictionary: `kABInsertedRecords`, `kABUpdatedRecords`, and `kABDeletedRecords`. The values for each of the keys are the unique IDs of the records that were inserted, updated, or deleted, respectively. If the values for all the keys are `nil`, every record has changes. For example, this happens when the Address Book database is restored from a backup copy.
Note
The system posts this notification on the main actor.
