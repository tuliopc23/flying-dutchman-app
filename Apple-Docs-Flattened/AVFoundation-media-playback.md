# Media playback
Manage the playback of media assets and interstitial content, independent of how you present that content in your interface.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/media-playback#overview)
You use a player to manage the playback and timing of a media asset, for example starting and stopping playback, and seeking to a particular time. A player manages the playback of a single media asset at a time. The framework also provides a queue player that queues media assets to play sequentially.
Note
When you use AVFoundation, Apple may collect metrics to help improve the framework.
You create an instance of [`AVPlayerItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayeritem) to play a media asset. A player item manages the timing and presentation state of an asset played by the player. A player item also contains player item tracks that correspond to the tracks in the asset. You direct the output of a player to a specialized Core Animation layer, a player layer, or a synchronized layer.
Important
You must call the [`VTRegisterProfessionalVideoWorkflowVideoDecoders()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/VideoToolbox/VTRegisterProfessionalVideoWorkflowVideoDecoders\(\)) function if your app requires Afterburner accelerated playback and decoding of ProRes and ProRes RAW video files.
