[`var interruptionHandler: (() -> Void)?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsxpcconnection/interruptionhandler)
An interruption handler that is called if the remote process exits or crashes.
[`var invalidationHandler: (() -> Void)?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsxpcconnection/invalidationhandler)
An invalidation handler that is called if the connection can not be formed or the connection has terminated and may not be re-established.
[`class func current() -> NSXPCConnection?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsxpcconnection/current\(\))
Returns the current connection, in the context of a call to a method on your exported object.
[`func scheduleSendBarrierBlock(() -> Void)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsxpcconnection/schedulesendbarrierblock\(_:\))
Add a barrier block to execute on the connection.
### [Managing the connection interface](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSXPCConnection#Managing-the-connection-interface)
[`var serviceName: String?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsxpcconnection/servicename)
The name of the XPC service that this connection was configured to connect to.
[`var endpoint: NSXPCListenerEndpoint`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsxpcconnection/endpoint)
If the connection was created with an [`NSXPCListenerEndpoint`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsxpclistenerendpoint) object, returns the endpoint object used.
[`var exportedInterface: NSXPCInterface?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsxpcconnection/exportedinterface)
The [`NSXPCInterface`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsxpcinterface) object that describes the protocol for the exported object on this connection.
