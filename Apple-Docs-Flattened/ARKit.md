# ARKit
Integrate hardware sensing features to produce augmented reality apps and games.
iOS 11.0+iPadOS 11.0+Mac Catalyst 14.0+visionOS 1.0+
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit#overview)
_Augmented reality_ (AR) describes user experiences that add 2D or 3D elements to the live view from a device’s sensors in a way that makes those elements appear to inhabit the real world. ARKit combines device motion tracking, world tracking, scene understanding, and display conveniences to simplify building an AR experience.
