Protocol
# NSPasteboardReading
A set of methods that defines the interface for initializing an object from a pasteboard.
macOS
```
protocol NSPasteboardReading : [NSObjectProtocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ObjectiveC/NSObjectProtocol)
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboardreading#overview)
The Cocoa framework classes [`NSString`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSString), [`NSAttributedString`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSAttributedString), [`NSURL`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSURL), [`NSColor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscolor), [`NSSound`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssound), [`NSImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimage), and [`NSPasteboardItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboarditem) implement this protocol. You can make your custom class conform to this protocol so that you can read instances from a pasteboard using the [`readObjects(forClasses:options:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboard/readobjects\(forclasses:options:\)) method of [`NSPasteboard`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboard).
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboardreading#topics)
### [Initializing the Pasteboard](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboardreading#Initializing-the-Pasteboard)
[`init?(pasteboardPropertyList: Any, ofType: NSPasteboard.PasteboardType)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboardreading/init\(pasteboardpropertylist:oftype:\))
Initializes an instance with a property list object and a type string.
**Required**
### [Reading From the Pasteboard](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboardreading#Reading-From-the-Pasteboard)
[`static func readableTypes(for: NSPasteboard) -> [NSPasteboard.PasteboardType]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboardreading/readabletypes\(for:\))
Returns an array of uniform type identifier strings of data types the receiver can read from the pasteboard and initialize from.
**Required**
[`static func readingOptions(forType: NSPasteboard.PasteboardType, pasteboard: NSPasteboard) -> NSPasteboard.ReadingOptions`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboardreading/readingoptions\(fortype:pasteboard:\))
Returns options for reading data of a specified type from a given pasteboard.
[`struct ReadingOptions`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboard/readingoptions)
Options that specify how to interpret data on the pasteboard when initializing pasteboard data.
