Protocol
# NSPasteboardWriting
A set of methods that defines the interface for retrieving a representation of an object that can be written to a pasteboard.
macOS
```
protocol NSPasteboardWriting : [NSObjectProtocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ObjectiveC/NSObjectProtocol)
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboardwriting#overview)
The Cocoa framework classes [`NSString`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSString), [`NSAttributedString`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSAttributedString), [`NSURL`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSURL), [`NSColor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscolor), [`NSSound`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssound), [`NSImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimage), and [`NSPasteboardItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboarditem) implement this protocol. You can make your custom class conform to this protocol so that you can write instances of the class to a pasteboard using the [`writeObjects(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboard/writeobjects\(_:\)) method of [`NSPasteboard`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboard).
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboardwriting#topics)

[`func writableTypes(for: NSPasteboard) -> [NSPasteboard.PasteboardType]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboardwriting/writabletypes\(for:\))
Returns an array of UTI strings of data types the receiver can write to a given pasteboard.
**Required**
[`func writingOptions(forType: NSPasteboard.PasteboardType, pasteboard: NSPasteboard) -> NSPasteboard.WritingOptions`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboardwriting/writingoptions\(fortype:pasteboard:\))
Returns options for writing data of a specified type to a given pasteboard.
[`struct WritingOptions`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboard/writingoptions)
Type to specify options for writing to a pasteboard.
### [Property List for Type](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboardwriting#Property-List-for-Type)
[`func pasteboardPropertyList(forType: NSPasteboard.PasteboardType) -> Any?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboardwriting/pasteboardpropertylist\(fortype:\))
Returns a property list object to represent the receiver on a pasteboard as an object of a specified type.
**Required**
### [Constants](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboardwriting#Constants)
[API Reference Pasteboard Writing Options](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/pasteboard-writing-options)
Constant to specify options for writing to a pasteboard, used by [`writingOptions(forType:pasteboard:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboardwriting/writingoptions\(fortype:pasteboard:\)).
[`struct WritingOptions`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboard/writingoptions)
Type to specify options for writing to a pasteboard.
