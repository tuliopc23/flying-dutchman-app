Protocol
# CVarArg
A type whose instances can be encoded, and appropriately passed, as elements of a C `va_list`.
iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.10+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+
```
protocol CVarArg
```

## [ Mentioned in ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/CVarArg#mentions)
[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/using-imported-c-functions-in-swift)
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/CVarArg#overview)
You use this protocol to present a native Swift interface to a C “varargs” API. For example, a program can import a C API like the one defined here:
```
int c_api(int, va_list arguments)

```

To create a wrapper for the `c_api` function, write a function that takes `CVarArg` arguments, and then call the imported C function using the `withVaList(_:_:)` function:
```
func swiftAPI(_ x: Int, arguments: CVarArg...) -> Int {
    return withVaList(arguments) { c_api(x, $0) }
}

```

Swift only imports C variadic functions that use a `va_list` for their arguments. C functions that use the `...` syntax for variadic arguments are not imported, and therefore can’t be called using `CVarArg` arguments.
If you need to pass an optional pointer as a `CVarArg` argument, use the `Int(bitPattern:)` initializer to interpret the optional pointer as an `Int` value, which has the same C variadic calling conventions as a pointer on all supported platforms.
Note
Declaring conformance to the `CVarArg` protocol for types defined outside the standard library is not supported.
