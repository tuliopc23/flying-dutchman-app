## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/argeotrackingstatus/accuracy-swift.enum/low#Discussion)
This value indicates that visual localization is complete and geo-tracking accuracy is low.
One technique an app can use to deal with low accuracy is to render location anchors with an asset that’s more forgiving, like a large ball. If an app renders the ball further in the air, any offset that results from low accuracy will be less noticeable, and less critical to the user.
