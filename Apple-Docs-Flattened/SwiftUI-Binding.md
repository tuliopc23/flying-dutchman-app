# Binding
A property wrapper type that can read and write a value owned by a source of truth.

[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/managing-search-interface-activation)
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding#overview)
Use a binding to create a two-way connection between a property that stores data, and a view that displays and changes the data. A binding connects a property to a source of truth stored elsewhere, instead of storing data directly. For example, a button that toggles between play and pause can create a binding to a property of its parent view using the `Binding` property wrapper.
```
struct PlayButton: View {
    @Binding var isPlaying: Bool


    var body: some View {
        Button(isPlaying ? "Pause" : "Play") {
            isPlaying.toggle()
        }
    }
}

```

The parent view declares a property to hold the playing state, using the [`State`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state) property wrapper to indicate that this property is the value’s source of truth.
```
struct PlayerView: View {
    var episode: Episode
    @State private var isPlaying: Bool = false


    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(episode.title)
                .foregroundStyle(isPlaying ? .primary : .secondary)
            PlayButton(isPlaying: $isPlaying) // Pass a binding.
        }
    }
}

```

When `PlayerView` initializes `PlayButton`, it passes a binding of its state property into the button’s binding property. Applying the `$` prefix to a property wrapped value returns its [`projectedValue`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state/projectedvalue), which for a state property wrapper returns a binding to the value.
Whenever the user taps the `PlayButton`, the `PlayerView` updates its `isPlaying` state.
A binding conforms to `Sendable` only if its wrapped value type also conforms to `Sendable`. It is always safe to pass a sendable binding between different concurrency domains. However, reading from or writing to a binding’s wrapped value from a different concurrency domain may or may not be safe, depending on how the binding was created. SwiftUI will issue a warning at runtime if it detects a binding being used in a way that may compromise data safety.
Note
To create bindings to properties of a type that conforms to the [`Observable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Observation/Observable) protocol, use the [`Bindable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/bindable) property wrapper. For more information, see [Migrating from the Observable Object protocol to the Observable macro](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/migrating-from-the-observable-object-protocol-to-the-observable-macro).
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding#topics)
### [Creating a binding](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding#Creating-a-binding)
[`init(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding/init\(_:\))
Creates a binding by projecting the base value to a hashable value.
[`init(projectedValue: Binding<Value>)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding/init\(projectedvalue:\))
Creates a binding from the value of another binding.
[`init(get:set:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding/init\(get:set:\))
Creates a binding with closures that read and write the binding value.
[`static func constant(Value) -> Binding<Value>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding/constant\(_:\))
Creates a binding with an immutable value.
### [Getting the value](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding#Getting-the-value)
[`var wrappedValue: Value`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding/wrappedvalue)
The underlying value referenced by the binding variable.
[`var projectedValue: Binding<Value>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding/projectedvalue)
A projection of the binding value that returns a binding.
[`subscript<Subject>(dynamicMember _: WritableKeyPath<Value, Subject>) -> Binding<Subject>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding/subscript\(dynamicmember:\))
Returns a binding to the resulting value of a given key path.
### [Managing changes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding#Managing-changes)
[`var id: Value.ID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding/id)
The stable identity of the entity associated with this instance, corresponding to the `id` of the binding’s wrapped value.
[`func animation(Animation?) -> Binding<Value>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding/animation\(_:\))
Specifies an animation to perform when the binding value changes.
[`func transaction(Transaction) -> Binding<Value>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding/transaction\(_:\))
Specifies a transaction for the binding.
[`var transaction: Transaction`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding/transaction)
The binding’s transaction.
