## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice#overview)
Capture devices provide media data to capture session inputs that you connect to an [`AVCaptureSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturesession). An individual device can provide one or more streams of media of a particular type.
You don’t create capture device instances directly. Instead, retrieve them using an instance of [`AVCaptureDevice.DiscoverySession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice/discoverysession), or by calling the [`default(_:for:position:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice/default\(_:for:position:\)) method.
A capture device provides several configuration options. Before attempting to configure device properties, such as its focus mode, exposure mode, and so on, you must first acquire a lock on the device by calling the [`lockForConfiguration()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice/lockforconfiguration\(\)) method. You should also query the device’s capabilities to ensure that the new modes you intend to set are valid for the device. You can then set the properties and release the lock using the [`unlockForConfiguration()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice/unlockforconfiguration\(\)) method. You may hold the lock if you want all settable device properties to remain unchanged. However, holding the device lock unnecessarily may degrade capture quality in other apps sharing the device and isn’t recommended.
