Sample Code
# Building a custom peer-to-peer protocol
Use networking frameworks to create a custom protocol for playing a game across iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS devices.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Network/building-a-custom-peer-to-peer-protocol#Overview)
This TicTacToe sample code project creates a networked game that you can play between different devices, communicating with a custom protocol. The game offers two ways to play:
  * On Apple TV, the game uses [DeviceDiscoveryUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeviceDiscoveryUI) to discover nearby iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS devices. After connecting, you can use your device to play against an AI opponent on Apple TV.
  * On iOS and iPadOS devices, the game uses Bonjour and TLS to establish secure connections between nearby devices. You can use this mode to play a peer-to-peer two-player game.
