## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcuiautomation/xcuiapplication/activate\(\)#Discussion)
This call is synchronous. The application is in a state ready to handle events when this method returns.
If the application isn’t running prior to calling [`activate()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcuiautomation/xcuiapplication/activate\(\)), it launches automatically.
If the application previously launched via [`launch()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcuiautomation/xcuiapplication/launch\(\)), the system supplies the launch arguments and environment variables from the original call to [`launch()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcuiautomation/xcuiapplication/launch\(\)) again.
Unlike [`launch()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcuiautomation/xcuiapplication/launch\(\)), a call to [`activate()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcuiautomation/xcuiapplication/activate\(\)) doesn’t terminate the existing instance if the application is already running.
The system reports any failure in the activation or launch sequence as a test failure and the test is halted at that point.
Current page is activate()
