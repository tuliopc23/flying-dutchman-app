Structure
# RawSpan
`RawSpan` represents a contiguous region of memory which contains initialized bytes.

struct RawSpan
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/RawSpan#overview)
A `RawSpan` instance is a non-owning, non-escaping view into memory. When a `RawSpan` is created, it inherits the lifetime of the container owning the contiguous memory, ensuring temporal safety and avoiding use-after-free errors. Operations on `RawSpan` are bounds-checked, ensuring spatial safety and avoiding buffer overflow errors.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/RawSpan#topics)
### [Initializers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/RawSpan#Initializers)
[`init()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/init\(\))
### [Instance Properties](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/RawSpan#Instance-Properties)
[`var byteCount: Int`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/bytecount)
The number of bytes in the span.
[`var byteOffsets: Range<Int>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/byteoffsets)
The indices that are valid for subscripting the span, in ascending order.
[`var isEmpty: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/isempty)
A Boolean value indicating whether the span is empty.
### [Instance Methods](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/RawSpan#Instance-Methods)
[`func byteOffsets(of: borrowing RawSpan) -> Range<Int>?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/byteoffsets\(of:\))
Returns the offsets where the memory of `span` is located within the memory represented by `self`
[`func extracting(Range<Int>) -> RawSpan`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/extracting\(_:\)-2imhy)

[`func extracting(droppingLast: Int) -> RawSpan`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/extracting\(droppinglast:\))
Returns a span over all but the given number of trailing bytes.
[`func extracting(first: Int) -> RawSpan`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/extracting\(first:\))
Returns a span containing the initial bytes of this span, up to the specified maximum byte count.
[`func extracting(last: Int) -> RawSpan`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/extracting\(last:\))
Returns a span containing the trailing bytes of the span, up to the given maximum length.
[`func extracting(unchecked: ClosedRange<Int>) -> RawSpan`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/extracting\(unchecked:\)-2hjqs)
Constructs a new span over the bytes within the supplied range of positions within this span.
[`func extracting(unchecked: Range<Int>) -> RawSpan`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/extracting\(unchecked:\)-527ri)
Constructs a new span over the bytes within the supplied range of positions within this span.
[`func isIdentical(to: RawSpan) -> Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/isidentical\(to:\))
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two `RawSpan` instances refer to the same region in memory.
[`func unsafeLoad<T>(fromByteOffset: Int, as: T.Type) -> T`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/unsafeload\(frombyteoffset:as:\))
Returns a new instance of the given type, constructed from the raw memory at the specified offset.
[`func unsafeLoad<T>(fromUncheckedByteOffset: Int, as: T.Type) -> T`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/unsafeload\(fromuncheckedbyteoffset:as:\))
Returns a new instance of the given type, constructed from the raw memory at the specified offset.
[`func unsafeLoadUnaligned<T>(fromByteOffset: Int, as: T.Type) -> T`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/unsafeloadunaligned\(frombyteoffset:as:\))
Returns a new instance of the given type, constructed from the raw memory at the specified offset.
[`func unsafeLoadUnaligned<T>(fromUncheckedByteOffset: Int, as: T.Type) -> T`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/unsafeloadunaligned\(fromuncheckedbyteoffset:as:\))
Returns a new instance of the given type, constructed from the raw memory at the specified offset.
[`func withUnsafeBytes<E, Result>((UnsafeRawBufferPointer) throws(E) -> Result) throws(E) -> Result`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawspan/withunsafebytes\(_:\))
Calls the given closure with a pointer to the underlying bytes of the viewed contiguous storage.
