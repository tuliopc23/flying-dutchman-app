Structure
# FocusState
A property wrapper type that can read and write a value that SwiftUI updates as the placement of focus within the scene changes.
iOS 15.0+iPadOS 15.0+Mac Catalyst 15.0+macOS 12.0+tvOS 15.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 8.0+
```
@frozen @propertyWrapper
struct FocusState<Value> where Value : [Hashable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Hashable)
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/FocusState#overview)
Use this property wrapper in conjunction with [`focused(_:equals:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/focused\(_:equals:\)) and [`focused(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/focused\(_:\)) to describe views whose appearance and contents relate to the location of focus in the scene. When focus enters the modified view, the wrapped value of this property updates to match a given prototype value. Similarly, when focus leaves, the wrapped value of this property resets to `nil` or `false`. Setting the property’s value programmatically has the reverse effect, causing focus to move to the view associated with the updated value.
In the following example of a simple login screen, when the user presses the Sign In button and one of the fields is still empty, focus moves to that field. Otherwise, the sign-in process proceeds.
```
struct LoginForm {
    enum Field: Hashable {
        case username
        case password
    }


    @State private var username = ""
    @State private var password = ""
    @FocusState private var focusedField: Field?


    var body: some View {
        Form {
            TextField("Username", text: $username)
                .focused($focusedField, equals: .username)


            SecureField("Password", text: $password)
                .focused($focusedField, equals: .password)


            Button("Sign In") {
                if username.isEmpty {
                    focusedField = .username
                } else if password.isEmpty {
                    focusedField = .password
                } else {
                    handleLogin(username, password)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

To allow for cases where focus is completely absent from a view tree, the wrapped value must be either an optional or a Boolean. Set the focus binding to `false` or `nil` as appropriate to remove focus from all bound fields. You can also use this to remove focus from a [`TextField`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/textfield) and thereby dismiss the keyboard.
### [Avoid ambiguous focus bindings](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/FocusState#Avoid-ambiguous-focus-bindings)
The same view can have multiple focus bindings. In the following example, setting `focusedField` to either `name` or `fullName` causes the field to receive focus:
```
struct ContentView: View {
    enum Field: Hashable {
        case name
        case fullName
    }
    @FocusState private var focusedField: Field?


    var body: some View {
        TextField("Full Name", ...)
            .focused($focusedField, equals: .name)
            .focused($focusedField, equals: .fullName)
    }
}

```

On the other hand, binding the same value to two views is ambiguous. In the following example, two separate fields bind focus to the `name` value:
```
struct ContentView: View {
    enum Field: Hashable {
        case name
        case fullName
    }
    @FocusState private var focusedField: Field?


    var body: some View {
        TextField("Name", ...)
            .focused($focusedField, equals: .name)
        TextField("Full Name", ...)
            .focused($focusedField, equals: .name) // incorrect re-use of .name
    }
}

```

If the user moves focus to either field, the `focusedField` binding updates to `name`. However, if the app programmatically sets the value to `name`, SwiftUI chooses the first candidate, which in this case is the “Name” field. SwiftUI also emits a runtime warning in this case, since the repeated binding is likely a programmer error.
### [Nest focusable views](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/FocusState#Nest-focusable-views)
It is important to consider the difference between [`focused(_:equals:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/focused\(_:equals:\)) and [`focused(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/focused\(_:\)) with nested focusable views.
For example, consider the following code:
```
struct ContentView: View {
    @FocusState private var fieldIsFocused: Bool
    @FocusState private var containerIsFocused: Bool


    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField("Name", ...)
                .focused($fieldIsFocused)
        }
        .focusable()
        .focused($containerIsFocused)
    }
}

```

The code above uses [`focused(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/focused\(_:\)), which binds focus state to the given Boolean state value. [`focused(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/focused\(_:\)) sets `containerIsFocused` to `true` both when the `VStack` itself receives focus and _just_ the `TextField` that it contains receives focus. This behavior occurs because two independent instances of `@FocusState` are used to observe the focus state of the focusable `VStack` and the `TextField`. When the `VStack` does not have focus, SwiftUI checks the view hierarchy to find the closest view with focus to set the value for `containerIsFocused`. If the `TextField` contained within this `VStack` happens to be focused, [`focused(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/focused\(_:\)) will set `containerIsFocused` to `true`.
If there is need to observe whether only the `VStack` has focus, but not the inner TextField, consider using [`focused(_:equals:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/focused\(_:equals:\)) instead, for more granular control.
With [`focused(_:equals:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/focused\(_:equals:\)), the above code can be rewritten as follows:
```
struct ContentView: View {
    enum Focus {
        case container
        case field
    }


    @FocusState private var focused: Focus?


    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField("Name", ...)
                .focused($focused, equals: .field)
        }
        .focusable()
        .focused($focused, equals: .container)
    }
}

```

With [`focused(_:equals:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/focused\(_:equals:\)), it is possible to define a custom data structure to represent focus state. In this case, a `Focus` enumeration is used. It has two cases, one for the focusable `VStack` and another for the `TextField` it contains. [`focused(_:equals:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/focused\(_:equals:\)) binds focused to `.container` only when the `VStack` itself has focus, and to `.field` when the `TextField` has focus. Because now there is only one `@FocusState` property, SwiftUI is able to disambiguate between cases when `VStack` _contains_ focus and _receives_ focus itself.
Note that both of the above approaches are acceptable. [`focused(_:equals:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/focused\(_:equals:\)) can be used to observe whether the given view currently receives focus. While [`focused(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/focused\(_:\)) can be used for the same purpose, additionally it can observe whether the given view contains focus.
