### [Configure the sample code project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/performing-fast-account-creation-with-passkeys#Configure-the-sample-code-project)
To configure the sample code project, do the following:
  1. In Xcode, click the project’s target, then select your team from the Team pop-up menu in the Signing & Capabilities pane to let Xcode automatically manage your provisioning profile.
  2. Add the Associated Domains capability using the + Capability button in the same pane, and specify your domain with the `webcredentials` service.
  3. Ensure an `apple-app-site-association` (AASA) file is present on your domain in the `.well-known` directory, and that it contains an entry for this app’s App ID for the `webcredentials` service.
  4. In the `SignUpView.swift` file, replace all occurrences of `example.com` with the name of your domain.
