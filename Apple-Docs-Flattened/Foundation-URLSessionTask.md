## [ Mentioned in ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessiontask#mentions)
[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/uploading-data-to-a-website)
[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/uploading-streams-of-data)
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessiontask#overview)
The [`URLSessionTask`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessiontask) class is the base class for tasks in a URL session. Tasks are always part of a session; you create a task by calling one of the task creation methods on a [`URLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) instance. The method you call determines the type of task.
  * Use [`URLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession)‘s [`dataTask(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/datatask\(with:\)-10dy7) and related methods to create [`URLSessionDataTask`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessiondatatask) instances. Data tasks request a resource, returning the server’s response as one or more `NSData` objects in memory. They are supported in default, ephemeral, and shared sessions, but are not supported in background sessions.
  * Use [`URLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession)‘s [`uploadTask(with:from:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/uploadtask\(with:from:\)) and related methods to create [`URLSessionUploadTask`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessionuploadtask) instances. Upload tasks are like data tasks, except that they make it easier to provide a request body so you can upload data before retrieving the server’s response. Additionally, upload tasks are supported in background sessions.
  * Use [`URLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession)’s [`downloadTask(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/downloadtask\(with:\)-1onj) and related methods to create [`URLSessionDownloadTask`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessiondownloadtask) instances. Download tasks download a resource directly to a file on disk. Download tasks are supported in any type of session.
  * Use [`URLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession)’s [`streamTask(withHostName:port:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/streamtask\(withhostname:port:\)) or [`streamTask(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession/streamtask\(with:\)) to create [`URLSessionStreamTask`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessionstreamtask) instances. Stream tasks establish a TCP/IP connection from a host name and port or a net service object.


After you create a task, you start it by calling its [`resume()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessiontask/resume\(\)) method. The session then maintains a strong reference to the task until the request finishes or fails; you don’t need to maintain a reference to the task unless it’s useful for your app’s internal bookkeeping.
Note
All task properties support key-value observing.
