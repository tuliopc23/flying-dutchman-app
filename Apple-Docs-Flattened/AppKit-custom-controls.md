# Custom Controls
Support accessibility for custom user interface elements by adopting a role-specific protocol and implementing its methods.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/custom-controls#overview)
Role-specific accessibility protocols represent the most common control types found in apps. Adopt a role-specific accessibility protocol if:
  * You’re creating a custom control that’s a subclass of [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview), and you want to modify the control’s behavior beyond what AppKit provides by default.
  * You’re working with a specialized control that doesn’t subclass [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview). See [`NSAccessibilityElement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsaccessibilityelement-swift.class) first.


First, identify the role-specific protocol that best matches your control’s intended behavior. For example, if your control is something that triggers actions when the user clicks it, adopt the [`NSAccessibilityButton`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsaccessibilitybutton) protocol.
After you select an appropriate protocol, adopt that protocol. The compiler may ask you to reimplement some of the [`NSAccessibilityProtocol`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsaccessibilityprotocol) protocol’s accessor or action methods. Simply implement these methods, and your control is ready to use.
