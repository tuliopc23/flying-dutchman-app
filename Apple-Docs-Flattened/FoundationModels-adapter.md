## [ Mentioned in ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter#mentions)
[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/loading-and-using-a-custom-adapter-with-foundation-models)
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter#overview)
Use the base system model for most prompt engineering, guided generation, and tools. If you need to specialize the model, train a custom `Adapter` to alter the system model weights and optimize it for your custom task. Use custom adapters only if you’re comfortable training foundation models in Python.
Important
Be sure to re-train the adapter for every new version of the base system model that Apple releases. Adapters consume a large amount of storage space and isn’t recommended for most apps.
For more on custom adapters, see [Get started with Foundation Models adapter training](https://developer.apple.com/apple-intelligence/foundation-models-adapter/).
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter#topics)
### [Creating an adapter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter#Creating-an-adapter)
[Loading and using a custom adapter with Foundation Models](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/loading-and-using-a-custom-adapter-with-foundation-models)
Specialize the behavior of the system language model by using a custom adapter you train.
[`com.apple.developer.foundation-model-adapter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Entitlements/com.apple.developer.foundation-model-adapter)
A Boolean value that indicates whether the app can enable custom adapters for the Foundation Models framework.
[`init(fileURL: URL) throws`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter/init\(fileurl:\))
Creates an adapter from the file URL.
[`init(name: String) throws`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter/init\(name:\))
Creates an adapter downloaded from the background assets framework.
### [Prepare the adapter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter#Prepare-the-adapter)
[`func compile() async throws`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter/compile\(\))
Prepares an adapter before being used with a [`LanguageModelSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/languagemodelsession). You should call this if your adapter has a draft model.
### [Getting the metadata](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter#Getting-the-metadata)
[`var creatorDefinedMetadata: [String : Any]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter/creatordefinedmetadata)
Values read from the creator defined field of the adapter’s metadata.
### [Removing obsolete adapters](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter#Removing-obsolete-adapters)
[`static func removeObsoleteAdapters() throws`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter/removeobsoleteadapters\(\))
Remove all obsolete adapters that are no longer compatible with current system models.
### [Checking compatibility](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter#Checking-compatibility)
[`static func compatibleAdapterIdentifiers(name: String) -> [String]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter/compatibleadapteridentifiers\(name:\))
Get all compatible adapter identifiers compatible with current system models.
[`static func isCompatible(AssetPack) -> Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter/iscompatible\(_:\))
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether an asset pack is an on-device foundation model adapter and is compatible with the system base model version on the runtime device.
### [Getting the asset error](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter#Getting-the-asset-error)
[`enum AssetError`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter/asseterror)
## [See Also](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter#see-also)
### [Loading the model with an adapter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/adapter#Loading-the-model-with-an-adapter)
[Loading and using a custom adapter with Foundation Models](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/loading-and-using-a-custom-adapter-with-foundation-models)
Specialize the behavior of the system language model by using a custom adapter you train.
[`com.apple.developer.foundation-model-adapter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Entitlements/com.apple.developer.foundation-model-adapter)
A Boolean value that indicates whether the app can enable custom adapters for the Foundation Models framework.
[`convenience init(adapter: SystemLanguageModel.Adapter, guardrails: SystemLanguageModel.Guardrails)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/init\(adapter:guardrails:\))
Creates the base version of the model with an adapter.
