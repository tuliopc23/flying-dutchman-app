Protocol
# Identifiable
A class of types whose instances hold the value of an entity with stable identity.
iOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.15+tvOS 13.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 6.0+
```
protocol Identifiable<[ID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/identifiable/id-swift.associatedtype)>
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Identifiable#overview)
Use the `Identifiable` protocol to provide a stable notion of identity to a class or value type. For example, you could define a `User` type with an `id` property that is stable across your app and your app’s database storage. You could use the `id` property to identify a particular user even if other data fields change, such as the user’s name.
`Identifiable` leaves the duration and scope of the identity unspecified. Identities can have any of the following characteristics:
  * Guaranteed always unique, like UUIDs.
  * Persistently unique per environment, like database record keys.
  * Unique for the lifetime of a process, like global incrementing integers.
  * Unique for the lifetime of an object, like object identifiers.
  * Unique within the current collection, like collection indices.


It’s up to both the conformer and the receiver of the protocol to document the nature of the identity.
# [Conforming to the Identifiable Protocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Identifiable#Conforming-to-the-Identifiable-Protocol)
`Identifiable` provides a default implementation for class types (using `ObjectIdentifier`), which is only guaranteed to remain unique for the lifetime of an object. If an object has a stronger notion of identity, it may be appropriate to provide a custom implementation.
