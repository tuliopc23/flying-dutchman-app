This class is a concrete subclass of [`AVCaptureInput`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcaptureinput) that you use to connect a capture device to a capture session.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput#topics)
### [Creating an input](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput#Creating-an-input)
[`init(device: AVCaptureDevice) throws`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/init\(device:\))
Creates an input for the specified capture device.
### [Configuring video properties](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput#Configuring-video-properties)
[`var unifiedAutoExposureDefaultsEnabled: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/unifiedautoexposuredefaultsenabled)
A Boolean value that indicates whether the input enables unified auto-exposure defaults.
[`var videoMinFrameDurationOverride: CMTime`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/videominframedurationoverride)
A time value that acts as a modifier to a capture device’s active video minimum frame duration.
### [Configuring audio properties](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput#Configuring-audio-properties)
[`func isMultichannelAudioModeSupported(AVCaptureMultichannelAudioMode) -> Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/ismultichannelaudiomodesupported\(_:\))
A Boolean value that indicates whether the input supports the specified multichannel audio mode.
[`var multichannelAudioMode: AVCaptureMultichannelAudioMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/multichannelaudiomode)
The multichannel audio mode to apply when recording audio.
[`enum AVCaptureMultichannelAudioMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturemultichannelaudiomode)
Constants that indicate the modes of multichannel audio.
[`var isWindNoiseRemovalSupported: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/iswindnoiseremovalsupported)
[`var isWindNoiseRemovalEnabled: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/iswindnoiseremovalenabled)
### [Configuring Cinematic video capture](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput#Configuring-Cinematic-video-capture)
[`var isCinematicVideoCaptureSupported: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/iscinematicvideocapturesupported)
A BOOL value specifying whether Cinematic Video capture is supported.
[`var isCinematicVideoCaptureEnabled: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/iscinematicvideocaptureenabled)
A BOOL value specifying whether the Cinematic Video effect is being applied to any movie file output, video data output, metadata output, or video preview layer added to the capture session.
[`var simulatedAperture: Float`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/simulatedaperture)
Shallow depth of field simulated aperture.
### [Locking frame duration](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput#Locking-frame-duration)
[`var activeLockedVideoFrameDuration: CMTime`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/activelockedvideoframeduration)
The receiver’s locked frame duration (the reciprocal of its frame rate). Setting this property guarantees the intra-frame duration delivered by the device input is precisely the frame duration you request.
[`var isLockedVideoFrameDurationSupported: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/islockedvideoframedurationsupported)
Indicates whether the device input supports locked frame durations.
### [Synchronizing with external devices](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput#Synchronizing-with-external-devices)
[`var isExternalSyncSupported: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/isexternalsyncsupported)
Indicates whether the device input supports being configured to follow an external sync device.
[`func follow(AVExternalSyncDevice, videoFrameDuration: CMTime, delegate: (any AVExternalSyncDeviceDelegate)?)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/follow\(_:videoframeduration:delegate:\))
Configures the the device input to follow an external sync device at the given frame duration.
[`func unfollowExternalSyncDevice()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/unfollowexternalsyncdevice\(\))
Discontinues external sync.
[`var activeExternalSyncVideoFrameDuration: CMTime`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/activeexternalsyncvideoframeduration)
The receiver’s external sync frame duration (the reciprocal of its frame rate) when being driven by an external sync device.
[`var externalSyncDevice: AVExternalSyncDevice?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/externalsyncdevice)
The external sync device currently being followed by this input.
### [Accessing the device](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput#Accessing-the-device)
[`var device: AVCaptureDevice`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/device)
A capture device associated with this input.
[`func ports(for: AVMediaType?, sourceDeviceType: AVCaptureDevice.DeviceType?, sourceDevicePosition: AVCaptureDevice.Position) -> [AVCaptureInput.Port]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeviceinput/ports\(for:sourcedevicetype:sourcedeviceposition:\))
