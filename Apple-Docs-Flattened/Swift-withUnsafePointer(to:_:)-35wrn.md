Function
# withUnsafePointer(to:_:)
Invokes the given closure with a pointer to the given argument.
iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.10+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+
```
func withUnsafePointer<T, E, Result>(
    to value: borrowing T,
    _ body: ([UnsafePointer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/unsafepointer)<T>) throws(E) -> Result
) throws(E) -> Result where E : [Error](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/error), T : ~Copyable, Result : ~Copyable
```

## [ Parameters ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/withUnsafePointer\(to:_:\)-35wrn#parameters) 

`value`
    
An instance to temporarily use via pointer. 

`body`
    
A closure that takes a pointer to `value` as its sole argument. If the closure has a return value, that value is also used as the return value of the `withUnsafePointer(to:_:)` function. The pointer argument is valid only for the duration of the function’s execution. It is undefined behavior to try to mutate through the pointer argument by converting it to `UnsafeMutablePointer` or any other mutable pointer type. If you need to mutate the argument through the pointer, use `withUnsafeMutablePointer(to:_:)` instead.
## [Return Value](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/withUnsafePointer\(to:_:\)-35wrn#return-value)
The return value, if any, of the `body` closure.
## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/withUnsafePointer\(to:_:\)-35wrn#discussion)
The `withUnsafePointer(to:_:)` function is useful for calling Objective-C APIs that take in parameters by const pointer.
The pointer argument to `body` is valid only during the execution of `withUnsafePointer(to:_:)`. Do not store or return the pointer for later use.

Invokes the given closure with a pointer to the given argument.
[`func withUnsafeMutablePointer<T, E, Result>(to: inout T, (UnsafeMutablePointer<T>) throws(E) -> Result) throws(E) -> Result`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/withunsafemutablepointer\(to:_:\))
Calls the given closure with a mutable pointer to the given argument.
[`func withUnsafeBytes<T, E, Result>(of: inout T, (UnsafeRawBufferPointer) throws(E) -> Result) throws(E) -> Result`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/withunsafebytes\(of:_:\)-5zxtl)
Invokes the given closure with a buffer pointer covering the raw bytes of the given argument.
[`func withUnsafeBytes<T, E, Result>(of: borrowing T, (UnsafeRawBufferPointer) throws(E) -> Result) throws(E) -> Result`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/withunsafebytes\(of:_:\)-5gesg)
Invokes the given closure with a buffer pointer covering the raw bytes of the given argument.
[`func withUnsafeMutableBytes<T, E, Result>(of: inout T, (UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer) throws(E) -> Result) throws(E) -> Result`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/withunsafemutablebytes\(of:_:\))
