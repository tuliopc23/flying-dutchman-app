Macro
# bundle()
Expands to a bundle instance that’s most likely to contain resources for the calling code.

macro bundle() -> [Bundle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/bundle)
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/bundle\(\)#overview)
Use the `#bundle` macro when you want to load resources like localized strings, images, or other items in a bundle regardless of whether your code executes in an app, a framework, or a Swift package. When invoked from an app, app extension, framework, or similar context, the expanded macro instantiates the bundle associated with that target. For code in a Swift package target, the macro provides the resource bundle associated with that target.
For example, the following code sets the localized text of a UIKit `UILabel` by explicitly loading the bundle associated with one of the app’s view controllers:
```
label.text = String(localized:"Game Over.",
                    bundle: Bundle(for: MyViewController.self),
                    comment: "Text for game over banner.")

```

You can simplify the `bundle:` parameter by invoking the `#bundle` macro instead, like this:
```
label.text = String(localized:"Game Over.",
                    bundle: #bundle,
                    comment: "Text for game over banner.")

```

The `#bundle` macro back-deploys to earlier versions of the OS, as indicated by the macro’s availability.
