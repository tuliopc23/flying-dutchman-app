# AVSynchronizedLayer
A Core Animation layer that derives its timing from a player item so that you can synchronize layer animations with media playback.
iOS 4.0+iPadOS 4.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.7+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+
```
class AVSynchronizedLayer
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsynchronizedlayer#overview)
You can create an arbitrary number of synchronized layers from the same `AVPlayerItem` object.
A synchronized layer is similar to a [`CATransformLayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore/CATransformLayer) object in that it doesn’t display anything itself, it just confers state upon its layer subtree. `AVSynchronizedLayer` confers its timing state, synchronizing the timing of layers in its subtree with that of a player item.
Any `CoreAnimation` layer with animation property set that is added as a sublayer of `AVSynchronizedLayer` should set the animation’s [`beginTime`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore/CAMediaTiming/beginTime) property to a non-zero positive value so animations will be interpreted on the player item’s timeline. `CoreAnimation` replaces the default `beginTime` of 0.0 with [`CACurrentMediaTime()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuartzCore/CACurrentMediaTime\(\)). To start the animation from time 0, use a small positive value like [`AVCoreAnimationBeginTimeAtZero`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcoreanimationbegintimeatzero).
You might use a layer as shown in the following example:
```
AVPlayerItem *playerItem = <#Get a player item#>;
CALayer *superLayer =  <#Get a layer#>;
// Set up a synchronized layer to sync the layer timing of its subtree
// with the playback of the playerItem/
AVSynchronizedLayer *syncLayer = [AVSynchronizedLayer synchronizedLayerWithPlayerItem:playerItem];
[syncLayer addSublayer:<#Another layer#>];    // These sublayers will be synchronized.
[superLayer addSublayer:syncLayer];

```
