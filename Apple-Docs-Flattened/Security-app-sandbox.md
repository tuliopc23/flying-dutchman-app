# App Sandbox
Restrict access to system resources and user data in macOS apps to contain damage if an app becomes compromised.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/app-sandbox#Overview)
App Sandbox provides protection to system resources and user data by limiting your app’s access to resources requested through entitlements.
Important
To distribute a macOS app through the Mac App Store, you must enable the App Sandbox capability.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/app-sandbox#topics)

[`App Sandbox Entitlement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Entitlements/com.apple.security.app-sandbox)
A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may use access control technology to contain damage to the system and user data if an app is compromised.
[Protecting user data with App Sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/protecting-user-data-with-app-sandbox)
Guard user data and operating system resources from malicious attacks by limiting your app’s access to files, network connections, and hardware capabilities.
[Embedding a command-line tool in a sandboxed app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/embedding-a-helper-tool-in-a-sandboxed-app)
Add a command-line tool to a sandboxed app’s Xcode project so the resulting app can run it as a helper tool.
[Discovering and diagnosing App Sandbox violations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/discovering-and-diagnosing-app-sandbox-violations)
Determine when your macOS app behaves incorrectly because of a sandbox violation, and fix sandbox-related issues.
