Class
# NSTreeNode
A node in a tree of nodes.
macOS 10.5+
```
class NSTreeNode
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstreenode#overview)
[`NSTreeNode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstreenode) simplifies the creation and management of trees of objects. Each tree node represents a model object. A tree node with `nil` as its parent node is considered the root of the tree.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstreenode#topics)
### [Creating tree nodes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstreenode#Creating-tree-nodes)
[`init(representedObject: Any?)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstreenode/init\(representedobject:\))
Initializes a newly allocated tree node that represents the specified object.
### [Getting information about a node](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstreenode#Getting-information-about-a-node)
[`var representedObject: Any?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstreenode/representedobject)
The object the tree node represents.
[`var indexPath: IndexPath`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstreenode/indexpath)
The position of the receiver relative to its root parent.
[`var isLeaf: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstreenode/isleaf)
A Boolean that indicates whether the receiver is a leaf node.
[`var children: [NSTreeNode]?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstreenode/children)
An array containing receiver’s child nodes.
[`var mutableChildren: NSMutableArray`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstreenode/mutablechildren)
A mutable array that provides read-write access to the receiver’s child nodes.
[`func descendant(at: IndexPath) -> NSTreeNode?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstreenode/descendant\(at:\))
Returns the receiver’s descendant at the specified index path.
[`var parent: NSTreeNode?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstreenode/parent)
The receiver’s parent node.
### [Sorting the subtree](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstreenode#Sorting-the-subtree)
[`func sort(with: [NSSortDescriptor], recursively: Bool)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstreenode/sort\(with:recursively:\))
Sorts the receiver’s subtree using the values of the represented objects with the specified sort descriptors.
