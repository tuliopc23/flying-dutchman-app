# Drag and Drop
Support the direct manipulation of your app’s content using drag and drop.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/drag-and-drop#overview)
With very little programming on your part, custom-view objects can be dragged and dropped anywhere. Objects become part of this dragging mechanism by conforming to dragging protocols: Draggable objects conform to the [`NSDraggingSource`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdraggingsource) protocol, and destination objects (that is, receivers of a drop) conform to the [`NSDraggingDestination`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdraggingdestination) protocol. AppKit hides all the details of tracking the cursor and displaying the dragged image.
Note
To learn how to adopt drag and drop in your iOS app, see [Drag and drop](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/drag-and-drop).
To learn how to use drag and drop for an image view, see [Supporting Drag and Drop Through File Promises](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/supporting-drag-and-drop-through-file-promises). To use drag and drop in a table view, see [Supporting Table View Drag and Drop Through File Promises](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/supporting-table-view-drag-and-drop-through-file-promises). For an example of drag and drop in a collection view, see [Supporting Collection View Drag and Drop Through File Promises](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/supporting-collection-view-drag-and-drop-through-file-promises), and for an outline view: [Navigating Hierarchical Data Using Outline and Split Views](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/navigating-hierarchical-data-using-outline-and-split-views).
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/drag-and-drop#topics)
### [Drag Sources](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/drag-and-drop#Drag-Sources)
Originate content from a drag source by creating items to represent that content.
[`protocol NSDraggingSource`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdraggingsource)
A set of methods that are implemented by the source object in a dragging session.
[`class NSDraggingItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdraggingitem)
A single dragged item within a dragging session.
[`class NSDraggingSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdraggingsession)
The encapsulation of a drag-and-drop action that supports modification of the drag while in progress.
[`class NSDraggingImageComponent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdraggingimagecomponent)
A single object in a dragging item.
### [Drop Targets](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/drag-and-drop#Drop-Targets)
Receive dragged content in your app’s objects.
[`protocol NSDraggingDestination`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdraggingdestination)
A set of methods that the destination object (or recipient) of a dragged image must implement.
[`protocol NSDraggingInfo`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdragginginfo)
A set of methods that supply information about a dragging session.
[`protocol NSSpringLoadingDestination`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsspringloadingdestination)
A set of methods that the destination object (or recipient) of a dragged object can implement to support spring-loading.
