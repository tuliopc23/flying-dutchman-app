Instance Method
# readData(ofLength:)
Reads data synchronously up to the specified number of bytes.
iOS 2.0–26.2DeprecatediPadOS 2.0–26.2DeprecatedMac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.0–26.2DeprecatedtvOS 9.0–26.2DeprecatedvisionOS 1.0–26.2DeprecatedwatchOS 2.0–26.0Deprecated
```
func readData(ofLength length: [Int](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Int)) -> [Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/data)
```

Deprecated
To handle errors when reading data from the file handle, use [`read(upToCount:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filehandle/read\(uptocount:\)) in Swift and [`readDataUpToLength:error:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsfilehandle/readdatauptolength:error:) in Objective-C.
## [ Parameters ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/FileHandle/readData\(ofLength:\)#parameters) 

`length`
    
The number of bytes to read from the file handle.
## [Return Value](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/FileHandle/readData\(ofLength:\)#return-value)
The data available through the receiver up to a maximum of `length` bytes, or the maximum size that can be represented by an [`NSData`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdata) object, whichever is the smaller.
## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/FileHandle/readData\(ofLength:\)#Discussion)
If the handle represents a file, this method returns the data obtained by reading `length` bytes starting at the current file pointer. If `length` bytes aren’t available, this method returns the data from the current file pointer to the end of the file. If the handle represents a communications channel, the method reads up to `length` bytes from the channel. Returns an empty `NSData` object if the handle is at the file’s end or if the communications channel returns an end-of-file indicator.
Important
This method raises [`fileHandleOperationException`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsexceptionname/filehandleoperationexception) if attempts to determine the file-handle type fail or if attempts to read from the file or channel fail.

Deprecated
[`func synchronizeFile()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filehandle/synchronizefile\(\))
Causes all in-memory data and attributes of the file represented by the handle to write to permanent storage.
Deprecated
[`func truncateFile(atOffset: UInt64)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filehandle/truncatefile\(atoffset:\))
Truncates or extends the file represented by the file handle to a specified offset within the file and puts the file pointer at that position.
