# Locale.Components
A type that represents the components of a locale, for use when creating a locale with specific overrides.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/Locale/Components#overview)
Use [`Locale.Components`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale/components) with the [`init(components:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale/init\(components:\)) initializer to create a custom [`Locale`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale) that overrides specific traits of a default locale. When you create a locale with components, the locale uses any overridden values instead of defaults preferred by the region or language. Leave a property `nil` to accept the default value.
The properties in this type correspond with those in [`Locale`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale), which declares them as read-only rather than read-write. You use this type to customize components when creating a custom locale, and use [`Locale`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale) to examine the components of an existing locale.
The following example creates a [`Locale.Components`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale/components) instance for US English, but then customizes its components. It sets the first day of the week to Monday and the hour cycle to zero-to-23. These components override the `en-US` defaults of Sunday and one-to-12, respectively. It then uses [`init(components:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale/init\(components:\)) to create a custom [`Locale`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale).
```
var components = Locale.Components(languageCode: "en", languageRegion: "US")
components.firstDayOfWeek = Locale.Weekday.monday
components.hourCycle = Locale.HourCycle.zeroToTwentyThree
let locale = Locale(components: components)

```
