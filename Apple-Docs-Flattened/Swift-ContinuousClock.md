# ContinuousClock
A clock that measures time that always increments and does not stop incrementing while the system is asleep.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/ContinuousClock#overview)
`ContinuousClock` can be considered as a stopwatch style time. The frame of reference of the `Instant` may be bound to process launch, machine boot or some other locally defined reference point. This means that the instants are only comparable locally during the execution of a program.
This clock is suitable for high resolution measurements of execution.
