A status indicating whether a path can be used by connections.
[`enum Status`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpath/status-swift.enum)
Status values indicating whether a path can be used by connections.
### [Inspecting Interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Network/NWPath#Inspecting-Interfaces)
[`func usesInterfaceType(NWInterface.InterfaceType) -> Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpath/usesinterfacetype\(_:\))
Checks if connections using the path may send traffic over a specific interface type.
[`let availableInterfaces: [NWInterface]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpath/availableinterfaces)
A list of all interfaces available to the path, in order of preference.
[`var gateways: [NWEndpoint]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpath/gateways)
A list of gateways configured on the interfaces available to a path.
