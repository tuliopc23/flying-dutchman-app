## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/all#Discussion)
This sequence returns the customer’s transaction history current to the moment you access it. The sequence emits a finite number of transactions. If the App Store processes additional transactions for the customer while you’re accessing this sequence, they appear in the transaction listener [`updates`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/updates).
The transaction history includes the following in-app purchases:
  * Unfinished consumables
  * Finished consumables that are refunded or revoked
  * Non-consumables
  * Auto-renewable subscriptions, including all renewals
  * Auto-renewable subscriptions and non-consumables that the customer gets through Family Sharing


By default, when the [`SKIncludeConsumableInAppPurchaseHistory`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/SKIncludeConsumableInAppPurchaseHistory) property list key is `false`, the transaction information excludes finished consumables (unless refunded or revoked).
To get all possible transactions, including all finished consumables, set the [`SKIncludeConsumableInAppPurchaseHistory`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/SKIncludeConsumableInAppPurchaseHistory) property list key to `true`.
