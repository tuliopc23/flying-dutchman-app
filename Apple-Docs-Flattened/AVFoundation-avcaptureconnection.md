Class
# AVCaptureConnection
An object that represents a connection from a capture input to a capture output.
iOS 4.0+iPadOS 4.0+Mac Catalyst 14.0+macOS 10.7+tvOS 17.0+visionOS 1.0+
```
class AVCaptureConnection
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcaptureconnection#overview)
Capture inputs have one or more input ports (instances of [`AVCaptureInput.Port`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcaptureinput/port)). Capture outputs can accept data from one or more sources (for example, an [`AVCaptureMovieFileOutput`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturemoviefileoutput) object accepts both video and audio data).
You can add an `AVCaptureConnection` instance to a session using the [`addConnection(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturesession/addconnection\(_:\)) method only if the [`canAddConnection(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturesession/canaddconnection\(_:\)) method returns [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/true). When using the [`addInput(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturesession/addinput\(_:\)) or [`addOutput(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturesession/addoutput\(_:\)) method, the session forms connections automatically between all compatible inputs and outputs. You only need to add connections manually when adding an input or output with no connections. You can also use connections to enable or disable the flow of data from a given input or to a given output.
