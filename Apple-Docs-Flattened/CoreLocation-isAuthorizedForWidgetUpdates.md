Instance Property
# isAuthorizedForWidgetUpdates
A Boolean value that indicates whether a widget is eligible to receive location updates.
iOS 14.0+iPadOS 14.0+Mac Catalyst 14.0+macOS 11.0+visionOS 1.0+
```
var isAuthorizedForWidgetUpdates: [Bool](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Bool) { get }
```

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreLocation/CLLocationManager/isAuthorizedForWidgetUpdates#Discussion)
This property is `true` when either of the following is true:
  * The app’s authorization status is [`CLAuthorizationStatus.authorizedAlways`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clauthorizationstatus/authorizedalways).
  * The app’s authorization status is [`CLAuthorizationStatus.authorizedWhenInUse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clauthorizationstatus/authorizedwheninuse) and the user agrees to extend the app’s authorization status to widgets.


Note
For apps that use [`CLAuthorizationStatus.authorizedWhenInUse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clauthorizationstatus/authorizedwheninuse), after the user agrees to extend an app’s authorization status to widgets, the app’s Location Services settings indicate While Using the App or Widgets as the active access level.
For details about using location information in widgets with [`CLAuthorizationStatus.authorizedWhenInUse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clauthorizationstatus/authorizedwheninuse), see [Accessing location information in widgets](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/WidgetKit/Accessing-Location-Information-in-Widgets).
