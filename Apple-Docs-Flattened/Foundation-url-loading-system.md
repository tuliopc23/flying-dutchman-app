# URL Loading System
Interact with URLs and communicate with servers using standard Internet protocols.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url-loading-system#overview)
The URL Loading System provides access to resources identified by URLs, using standard protocols like `https` or custom protocols you create. Loading is performed asynchronously, so your app can remain responsive and handle incoming data or errors as they arrive.
You use a [`URLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) instance to create one or more [`URLSessionTask`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessiontask) instances, which can fetch and return data to your app, download files, or upload data and files to remote locations. To configure a session, you use a [`URLSessionConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessionconfiguration) object, which controls behavior like how to use caches and cookies, or whether to allow connections on a cellular network.
You can use one session repeatedly to create tasks. For example, a web browser might have separate sessions for regular and private browsing use, where the private session doesn’t cache its data. [Figure 1](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url_loading_system#2927983) shows how two sessions with these configurations can then create multiple tasks.
![Figure showing two scenarios, default browsing and private browsing, each with a URL Session creating multiple URL Session Tasks. In the default browsing case, the URL Session contains a default configuration. In the private browsing case, it contains an ephemeral configuration.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/cbc45a3ebfd73610ee2e1296aa49f88e/media-2927983%402x.png)
Each session is associated with a delegate to receive periodic updates (or errors). The default delegate calls a completion handler block that you provide; if you choose to provide your own custom delegate, this block is not called.
You can configure a session to run in the background, so that while the app is suspended, the system can download data on its behalf and wake up the app to deliver the results.
