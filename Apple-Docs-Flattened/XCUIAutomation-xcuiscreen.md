## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcuiautomation/xcuiscreen#overview)
Call the [`screenshot()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcuiautomation/xcuiscreenshotproviding/screenshot\(\)) method on an [`XCUIScreen`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcuiautomation/xcuiscreen) instance to capture a screenshot of its current UI state. The [`XCUIScreenshotProviding`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcuiautomation/xcuiscreenshotproviding) protocol adds this method to [`XCUIScreen`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcuiautomation/xcuiscreen).
You can take a screenshot of the current device’s main screen using the following code:
```
let screenshot = XCUIScreen.main.screenshot()

```

You can take a screenshot of every screen on the current device using the following code:
```
let allScreenshots = XCUIScreen.screens.map { screen in
    return screen.screenshot()
}

```
