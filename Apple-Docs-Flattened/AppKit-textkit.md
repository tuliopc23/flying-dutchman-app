# TextKit
Manage text storage and perform custom layout of text-based content in your app’s views.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/textkit#overview)
TextKit provides several classes to control the layout of text, such as [`NSTextContentStorage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstextcontentstorage), [`NSTextLayoutManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstextlayoutmanager), and [`NSTextContainer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstextcontainer).
Additionally, TextKit uses [`NSAttributedString`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSAttributedString) objects extensively. The [`NSTextStorage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstextstorage) class is a subclass of [`NSMutableAttributedString`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSMutableAttributedString), and many of the TextKit classes, for example, the classes listed in `Formatted content`, focus on creating complex [`NSAttributedString`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSAttributedString) instances. Use these classes to specify your text’s format.
Most of the time, you can use TextKit to fine tune the formatting and layout of a [`NSTextView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstextview) by modifying various properties of your view’s layout manager, text container, or text storage objects in your app. If you need more control, you can also use TextKit to build your text controls.
