## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymentqueue/restorecompletedtransactions\(\)#Discussion)
Use this method to restore finished transactions—that is, transactions for which you have already called [`finishTransaction(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymentqueue/finishtransaction\(_:\)). You call this method in one of the following situations:
  * To install purchases on additional devices
  * To restore purchases for an application that the user deleted and reinstalled


When you create a new product to be sold in your store, you choose whether that product can be restored or not. See the [In-App Purchase Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StoreKitGuide/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008267) for more information.
The payment queue delivers a new transaction for each previously completed transaction that can be restored. Each transaction includes a copy of the original transaction.
After the transactions are delivered, the payment queue calls the observer’s [`paymentQueueRestoreCompletedTransactionsFinished(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymenttransactionobserver/paymentqueuerestorecompletedtransactionsfinished\(_:\)) method. If an error occurred while restoring transactions, the observer will be notified through its [`paymentQueue(_:restoreCompletedTransactionsFailedWithError:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymenttransactionobserver/paymentqueue\(_:restorecompletedtransactionsfailedwitherror:\)) method.
This method has no effect in the following situations:
  * All transactions are unfinished.
  * The user did not purchase anything that is restorable.
  * You tried to restore items that are not restorable, such as a non-renewing subscription or a consumable product.
  * Your app’s build version does not meet the guidelines for the `CFBundleVersion` key.


Important
If you are using the [In-App Purchase](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app-purchase) API and managing transactions using the [`Transaction`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction) API, use [`currentEntitlements`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/currententitlements) to determine which in-app purchases the customer is currently entitled to. The [`restoreCompletedTransactions()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymentqueue/restorecompletedtransactions\(\)) function doesn’t affect transactions in the [`Transaction`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction) API. In rare cases when a user suspects the app isn’t showing all the transactions, call [`sync()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/appstore/sync\(\)) in response to an explicit user action, like tapping a button.
