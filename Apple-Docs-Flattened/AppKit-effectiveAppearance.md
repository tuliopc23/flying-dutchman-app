Instance Property
# effectiveAppearance
The appearance that AppKit uses to draw the app’s interface.
macOS 10.14+
```
@[MainActor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/MainActor)
var effectiveAppearance: [NSAppearance](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsappearance) { get }
```

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSApplication/effectiveAppearance#Discussion)
This property always contains an [`NSAppearance`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsappearance) object representing the appearance to use during drawing. If you don’t explicitly assign a value to the [`appearance`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/appearance) property, the app inherits the system’s effective appearance.

### [Managing the app’s appearance](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSApplication/effectiveAppearance#Managing-the-apps-appearance)
[`var appearance: NSAppearance?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/appearance)
The appearance associated with the app’s windows.
[`var currentSystemPresentationOptions: NSApplication.PresentationOptions`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/currentsystempresentationoptions)
The set of app presentation options that are currently in effect for the system.
[`var presentationOptions: NSApplication.PresentationOptions`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/presentationoptions-swift.property)
The presentation options that should be in effect for the system when this app is active.
[`struct PresentationOptions`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/presentationoptions-swift.struct)
Constants that control the presentation of the app, typically for fullscreen apps such as games or kiosks.
[`var applicationShouldSuppressHighDynamicRangeContent: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/applicationshouldsuppresshighdynamicrangecontent)
A boolean value indicating whether your application should suppress HDR content based on established policy. Built-in AppKit components such as NSImageView will automatically behave correctly with HDR content. You should use this value in conjunction with notifications (`NSApplicationShouldBeginSuppressingHighDynamicRangeContentNotification` and `NSApplicationShouldEndSuppressingHighDynamicRangeContentNotification`) to suppress HDR content in your application when signaled to do so.
