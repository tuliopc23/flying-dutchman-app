# Data types
Specify the kind of data used in HealthKit.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/data-types#overview)
HealthKit uses [`HKObjectType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkobjecttype) subclasses to identify the different types of data stored in HealthKit, from inherent data that doesn’t typically change over time to complex data types that combine multiple samples or compute values over sets of samples.
To create a type object, call the appropriate [`HKObjectType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkobjecttype) class method, and pass in the desired type identifier.
```
let bloodType = HKObjectType.characteristicType(forIdentifier: .bloodType)


let caloriesConsumed = HKObjectType.quantityType(forIdentifier: .dietaryEnergyConsumed)


let sleepAnalysis = HKObjectType.categoryType(forIdentifier: .sleepAnalysis)

```

You can use the resulting object types to request permission to access the data, save new data to the HealthKit store, or read data from the HealthKit store.
