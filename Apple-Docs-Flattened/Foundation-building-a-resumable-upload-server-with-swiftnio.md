# Building a resumable upload server with SwiftNIO
Support HTTP resumable upload protocol in SwiftNIO by translating resumable uploads to regular uploads.
[ Download ](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/eecdd62f298f/BuildingAResumableUploadServerWithSwiftNIO.zip)
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/building-a-resumable-upload-server-with-swiftnio#Overview)
Note
This sample code project is associated with WWDC23 session 10006: [Build robust and resumable file transfers](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10006/).
### [Configure the sample code project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/building-a-resumable-upload-server-with-swiftnio#Configure-the-sample-code-project)
Before you run the sample code project:
  1. In the `Package.swift` file of an existing HTTP server project, add `.package(path: "/path/to/swift-nio-resumable-upload")` as one of the dependencies.
  2. Import `NIOResumableUpload` in your SwiftNIO bootstrapping code.
  3. Create an upload context: `let uploadContext = HTTPResumableUploadContext(origin: "https://example.com")`.
  4. Wrap your HTTP server channel handler within `HTTPResumableUploadHandler`.
