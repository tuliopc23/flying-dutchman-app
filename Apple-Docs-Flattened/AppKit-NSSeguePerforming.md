Protocol
# NSSeguePerforming
A set of methods that support the mediation of a custom segue.
macOS
```
protocol NSSeguePerforming : [NSObjectProtocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ObjectiveC/NSObjectProtocol)
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssegueperforming#overview)
When you subclass [`NSStoryboardSegue`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsstoryboardsegue) to express a custom transition or containment relationship between storyboard scenes, you might also want to provide code that prepares the destination/contained view or window controller object. Put this code in an override of the [`prepare(for:sender:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssegueperforming/prepare\(for:sender:\)) method.
To conditionally disallow the performance of a segue, override the [`shouldPerformSegue(withIdentifier:sender:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssegueperforming/shouldperformsegue\(withidentifier:sender:\)) method, returning [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/false).If you need to programmatically trigger a segue that cannot be expressed in a storyboard file, such as a transition between scenes in different storyboards, use the [`performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssegueperforming/performsegue\(withidentifier:sender:\)) method in this protocol.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssegueperforming#topics)
### [Working with Storyboard Segues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssegueperforming#Working-with-Storyboard-Segues)
[`func performSegue(withIdentifier: NSStoryboardSegue.Identifier, sender: Any?)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssegueperforming/performsegue\(withidentifier:sender:\))
Performs the specified segue.
[`func prepare(for: NSStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssegueperforming/prepare\(for:sender:\))
Called when a segue is about to be performed.
[`func shouldPerformSegue(withIdentifier: NSStoryboardSegue.Identifier, sender: Any?) -> Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssegueperforming/shouldperformsegue\(withidentifier:sender:\))
Called immediately prior to the performance of a storyboard segue.
