# Widgets and watch complications
Allow people to personalize their devices, view relevant information, and perform interactions with widgets and watch complications.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/widgets-and-complications-collection#overview)
Use WidgetKit to create widgets and watch complications that elevate a small amount of timely, personally relevant information from your app and allow people to perform quick actions without launching your app:
  * On iPhone and iPad, people put widgets in Today View, on the Home Screen, and on the Lock Screen.
  * On Mac, people place macOS widgets and widgets from a paired iPhone in locations like the Mac desktop and in Notification Center.
  * On Apple Watch, widgets appear in the Smart Stack and as watch complications.
  * On Apple Vision Pro, widgets become three-dimensional objects that people pin to horizontal and vertical surfaces.
  * In CarPlay, people configure iPhone widgets to appear on the widgets screen.
