Starts a new scope that can contain a dynamic number of child tasks.
[`struct UnsafeCurrentTask`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/unsafecurrenttask)
An unsafe reference to the current task.
### [Asynchronous Sequences](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/concurrency#Asynchronous-Sequences)
[`protocol AsyncSequence`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncsequence)
A type that provides asynchronous, sequential, iterated access to its elements.
[`struct AsyncStream`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncstream)

[`struct AsyncThrowingStream`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncthrowingstream)

[`func withCheckedContinuation<T>(isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, function: String, (CheckedContinuation<T, Never>) -> Void) async -> sending T`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/withcheckedcontinuation\(isolation:function:_:\))
Invokes the passed in closure with a checked continuation for the current task.
[`func withCheckedThrowingContinuation<T>(isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, function: String, (CheckedContinuation<T, any Error>) -> Void) async throws -> sending T`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/withcheckedthrowingcontinuation\(isolation:function:_:\))
Invokes the passed in closure with a checked continuation for the current task.
[`struct UnsafeContinuation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/unsafecontinuation)
A mechanism to interface between synchronous and asynchronous code, without correctness checking.
[`func withUnsafeContinuation<T>(isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, (UnsafeContinuation<T, Never>) -> Void) async -> sending T`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/withunsafecontinuation\(isolation:_:\))
Invokes the passed in closure with a unsafe continuation for the current task.
[`typealias UnsafeThrowingContinuation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/unsafethrowingcontinuation)Deprecated
[`func withUnsafeThrowingContinuation<T>(isolation: isolated (any Actor)?, (UnsafeContinuation<T, any Error>) -> Void) async throws -> sending T`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/withunsafethrowingcontinuation\(isolation:_:\))
Invokes the passed in closure with a unsafe continuation for the current task.
### [Actors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/concurrency#Actors)
[`protocol Sendable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sendable)
A thread-safe type whose values can be shared across arbitrary concurrent contexts without introducing a risk of data races.
[`protocol Actor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/actor)
Common protocol to which all actors conform.
[`typealias AnyActor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/anyactor)
Common marker protocol providing a shared “base” for both (local) `Actor` and (potentially remote) `DistributedActor` types.
Deprecated
[`actor MainActor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/mainactor)
A singleton actor whose executor is equivalent to the main dispatch queue.
[`protocol GlobalActor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/globalactor)
A type that represents a globally-unique actor that can be used to isolate various declarations anywhere in the program.
[`protocol SendableMetatype`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sendablemetatype)
A type whose metatype can be shared across arbitrary concurrent contexts without introducing a risk of data races. When a generic type `T` conforms to `SendableMetatype`, its metatype `T.Type` conforms to `Sendable`. All concrete types implicitly conform to the `SendableMetatype` protocol, so its primary purpose is in generic code to prohibit the use of isolated conformances along with the generic type.
[`typealias ConcurrentValue`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/concurrentvalue)Deprecated
[`protocol UnsafeSendable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/unsafesendable)
A type whose values can safely be passed across concurrency domains by copying, but which disables some safety checking at the conformance site.
Deprecated
[`typealias UnsafeConcurrentValue`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/unsafeconcurrentvalue)Deprecated
[`macro isolation<T>() -> T`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/isolation\(\))
Produce a reference to the actor to which the enclosing code is isolated, or `nil` if the code is nonisolated.
[`func extractIsolation<each Arg, Result>((repeat each Arg) async throws -> Result) -> (any Actor)?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/extractisolation\(_:\))Deprecated
### [Task-Local Storage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/concurrency#Task-Local-Storage)
[`class TaskLocal`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/tasklocal)
Wrapper type that defines a task-local value key.
[`macro TaskLocal()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/tasklocal\(\))
Macro that introduces a [`TaskLocal`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/tasklocal) binding.

[`typealias PartialAsyncTask`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/partialasynctask)Deprecated
[`struct UnownedJob`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/unownedjob)
A unit of schedulable work.
[`struct JobPriority`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/jobpriority)
The priority of this job.
[`struct UnownedSerialExecutor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/unownedserialexecutor)

Configure the current task hierarchy’s task executor preference to the passed [`TaskExecutor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/taskexecutor), and execute the passed in closure by immediately hopping to that executor.
### [Deprecated](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/concurrency#Deprecated)
