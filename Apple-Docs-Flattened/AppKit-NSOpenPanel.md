Class
# NSOpenPanel
A panel that prompts the user to select a file to open.
macOS
```
@[MainActor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/MainActor)
class NSOpenPanel
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSOpenPanel#overview)
Apps use the Open panel as a convenient way to query the user for the name of a file to open. In macOS 10.15 and later, the system always draws Open panels in a separate process, regardless of whether the app is sandboxed. When the user chooses a file to open, macOS adds that file to the app’s sandbox. Prior to macOS 10.15, the system drew the panels in a separate process only for sandboxed apps.
