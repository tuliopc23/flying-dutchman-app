Class
# NSText
The most general programmatic interface for objects that manage text.
macOS
```
@[MainActor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/MainActor)
class NSText
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstext#overview)
[`NSText`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstext) draws text for user interface objects, provides text editing capabilities, and controls text attributes such as type size, font, and color.
[`NSText`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstext) initialization creates an instance of a concrete subclass, such as [`NSTextView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstextview) (generically called a text object). In general, you’re more likely to use the [`NSTextView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstextview) subclass, because it extends the interface declared by [`NSText`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstext) and provides much more sophisticated functionality than that declared in [`NSText`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstext).
AppKit uses text objects wherever text appears in interface objects. For example, a text object draws the title of a window, the commands in a menu, the title of a button, and the items in a browser. Your app can also create text objects for its own purposes.
