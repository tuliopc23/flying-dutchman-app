Protocol
# Actor
Common protocol to which all actors conform.
iOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.15+tvOS 13.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 6.0+
```
protocol Actor : AnyObject, [Sendable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sendable)
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Actor#overview)
The `Actor` protocol generalizes over all `actor` types. Actor types implicitly conform to this protocol.
### [Actors and SerialExecutors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Actor#Actors-and-SerialExecutors)
By default, actors execute tasks on a shared global concurrency thread pool. This pool is shared by all default actors and tasks, unless an actor or task specified a more specific executor requirement.
It is possible to configure an actor to use a specific [`SerialExecutor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/serialexecutor), as well as impact the scheduling of default tasks and actors by using a [`TaskExecutor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/taskexecutor).

## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Actor#topics)
### [Instance Properties](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Actor#Instance-Properties)
[`var unownedExecutor: UnownedSerialExecutor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/actor/unownedexecutor)
Retrieve the executor for this actor as an optimized, unowned reference.
**Required**
### [Instance Methods](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Actor#Instance-Methods)
[`func assertIsolated(@autoclosure () -> String, file: StaticString, line: UInt)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/actor/assertisolated\(_:file:line:\))
Stops program execution if the current task is not executing on this actor’s serial executor.
[`func assumeIsolated<T>((isolated Self) throws -> T, file: StaticString, line: UInt) rethrows -> T`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/actor/assumeisolated\(_:file:line:\))
Assume that the current task is executing on this actor’s serial executor, or stop program execution otherwise.
[`func preconditionIsolated(@autoclosure () -> String, file: StaticString, line: UInt)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/actor/preconditionisolated\(_:file:line:\))
Stops program execution if the current task is not executing on this actor’s serial executor.

### [Actors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Actor#Actors)
[`protocol Sendable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sendable)
A thread-safe type whose values can be shared across arbitrary concurrent contexts without introducing a risk of data races.
[`typealias AnyActor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/anyactor)
Common marker protocol providing a shared “base” for both (local) `Actor` and (potentially remote) `DistributedActor` types.
Deprecated
[`actor MainActor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/mainactor)
A singleton actor whose executor is equivalent to the main dispatch queue.
[`protocol GlobalActor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/globalactor)
A type that represents a globally-unique actor that can be used to isolate various declarations anywhere in the program.
[`protocol SendableMetatype`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sendablemetatype)
A type whose metatype can be shared across arbitrary concurrent contexts without introducing a risk of data races. When a generic type `T` conforms to `SendableMetatype`, its metatype `T.Type` conforms to `Sendable`. All concrete types implicitly conform to the `SendableMetatype` protocol, so its primary purpose is in generic code to prohibit the use of isolated conformances along with the generic type.
[`typealias ConcurrentValue`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/concurrentvalue)Deprecated
[`protocol UnsafeSendable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/unsafesendable)
A type whose values can safely be passed across concurrency domains by copying, but which disables some safety checking at the conformance site.
Deprecated
[`typealias UnsafeConcurrentValue`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/unsafeconcurrentvalue)Deprecated
[`macro isolation<T>() -> T`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/isolation\(\))
Produce a reference to the actor to which the enclosing code is isolated, or `nil` if the code is nonisolated.
[`func extractIsolation<each Arg, Result>((repeat each Arg) async throws -> Result) -> (any Actor)?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/extractisolation\(_:\))Deprecated
