Class
# AVPlaybackCoordinator
An object that coordinates the playback of players in a connected group.
iOS 15.0+iPadOS 15.0+Mac Catalyst 15.0+macOS 12.0+tvOS 15.0+visionOS 1.0+
```
class AVPlaybackCoordinator
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVFoundation/AVPlaybackCoordinator#overview)
The framework provides two playback coordinator subclasses that manage different types of player objects:
  * [`AVPlayerPlaybackCoordinator`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayerplaybackcoordinator) coordinates the state of [`AVPlayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayer) objects. If your app uses [`AVPlayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayer), continue to use its standard interfaces to control playback. The coordinator intercepts changes to the player’s rate and time, and propagates them to other players in the group.
  * [`AVDelegatingPlaybackCoordinator`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avdelegatingplaybackcoordinator) coordinates the state of custom player objects. If your app uses a custom player, such as one that renders media using [`AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebufferdisplaylayer) and [`AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebufferaudiorenderer), use this object to coordinate group playback. Adopt the coordinator’s delegate protocol so that your player responds to the commands that the coordinator issues.


Note
Use the [Group Activities](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/GroupActivities) framework to connect a playback coordinator to its peers.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVFoundation/AVPlaybackCoordinator#topics)
### [Configuring playback policies](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVFoundation/AVPlaybackCoordinator#Configuring-playback-policies)
[`func participantLimitForWaitingOutSuspensions(withReason: AVCoordinatedPlaybackSuspension.Reason) -> Int`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplaybackcoordinator/participantlimitforwaitingoutsuspensions\(withreason:\))
Returns the limit on the number of partipants that a group may contain before the coordinator stops waiting on suspensions that occur for a particular reason.
[`func setParticipantLimit(Int, forWaitingOutSuspensionsWithReason: AVCoordinatedPlaybackSuspension.Reason)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplaybackcoordinator/setparticipantlimit\(_:forwaitingoutsuspensionswithreason:\))
Sets a limit on the number of partipants that a group may contain before the coordinator stops waiting on suspensions that occur for a particular reason.
[`var suspensionReasonsThatTriggerWaiting: [AVCoordinatedPlaybackSuspension.Reason]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplaybackcoordinator/suspensionreasonsthattriggerwaiting)
The reasons that cause a coordinator to suspend playback.
[`var pauseSnapsToMediaTimeOfOriginator: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplaybackcoordinator/pausesnapstomediatimeoforiginator)
A Boolean value that indicates whether participants mirror the originator’s stop time when they pause.
### [Suspending state coordination](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVFoundation/AVPlaybackCoordinator#Suspending-state-coordination)
[`func beginSuspension(for: AVCoordinatedPlaybackSuspension.Reason) -> AVCoordinatedPlaybackSuspension`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplaybackcoordinator/beginsuspension\(for:\))
Tells the coordinator to stop sending playback commands temporarily when the playback object disconnects from the group activity.
[`class AVCoordinatedPlaybackSuspension`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcoordinatedplaybacksuspension)
An object that represents a temporary suspension of coordinated playback.
[`func expectedItemTime(atHostTime: CMTime) -> CMTime`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplaybackcoordinator/expecteditemtime\(athosttime:\))
Returns a time in the current item’s timeline that the coordinator expects to play at the specified host time.
### [Observing suspension reasons](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVFoundation/AVPlaybackCoordinator#Observing-suspension-reasons)
[`var suspensionReasons: [AVCoordinatedPlaybackSuspension.Reason]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplaybackcoordinator/suspensionreasons)
The reasons a coordinator is currently unable to participate in a group playback activity.
[`class let suspensionReasonsDidChangeNotification: NSNotification.Name`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplaybackcoordinator/suspensionreasonsdidchangenotification)
A notification that the coordinator posts when its suspension reasons change.
### [Observing other participants](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVFoundation/AVPlaybackCoordinator#Observing-other-participants)
[`var otherParticipants: [AVCoordinatedPlaybackParticipant]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplaybackcoordinator/otherparticipants)
The identifiers of the other participants in a group.
[`class AVCoordinatedPlaybackParticipant`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcoordinatedplaybackparticipant)
An object that represents a participant in a coordinated playback session.
[`class let otherParticipantsDidChangeNotification: NSNotification.Name`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplaybackcoordinator/otherparticipantsdidchangenotification)
A notification that the coordinator posts when its other participants change.
### [Coordinating with group sessions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVFoundation/AVPlaybackCoordinator#Coordinating-with-group-sessions)
[`func coordinateWithSession<T>(GroupSession<T>)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplaybackcoordinator/coordinatewithsession\(_:\))
Begins coordination of a player with a group session.
