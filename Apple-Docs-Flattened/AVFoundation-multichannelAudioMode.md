iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Mac Catalyst 18.0+macOS 15.0+tvOS 18.0+
```
var multichannelAudioMode: [AVCaptureMultichannelAudioMode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturemultichannelaudiomode) { get set }
```

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVFoundation/AVCaptureDeviceInput/multichannelAudioMode#Discussion)
This property only takes effect when the system routes audio through the built-in microphone. The system ignores the value when an external microphone is in use.
The default value is [`AVCaptureMultichannelAudioMode.none`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturemultichannelaudiomode/none), which indicates to use single channel audio recording.
