## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/Progress/cancel\(\)#Discussion)
This method invokes the block for [`cancellationHandler`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/progress/cancellationhandler), if there is one, and ensures that any subsequent reads of the [`isCancelled`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/progress/iscancelled) property return [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/true).
If the receiver has suboperations, the system cancels their progress as well.
