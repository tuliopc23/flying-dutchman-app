## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Color/ResolvedHDR#overview)
`Color.ResolvedHDR` is a set of RGBA values that represent a color that can be shown. The color components are stored in the extended sRGB color space and may contain a “headroom” value describing how the color is rendered for displays with different dynamic ranges. This is a low-level type, most colors are represented by the `Color` type.
