Type Property
# externalUnknown
An unknown external device type.
macOS 10.15–14.0Deprecated
```
static let externalUnknown: [AVCaptureDevice](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice).[DeviceType](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice/devicetype-swift.struct)
```

Deprecated
Use [`external`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice/devicetype-swift.struct/external) instead.
## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice/devicetype-swift.struct/externalunknown#Discussion)
In macOS, use this type to specify external devices, such as an iPhone camera.
Important
In [Mac Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/mac-catalyst) apps, use [`builtInWideAngleCamera`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice/devicetype-swift.struct/builtinwideanglecamera) instead.
