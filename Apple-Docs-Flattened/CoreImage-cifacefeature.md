Class
# CIFaceFeature
Information about a face detected in a still or video image.
iOS 5.0+iPadOS 5.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.7+tvOSvisionOS 1.0+
```
class CIFaceFeature
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifacefeature#overview)
Note
In macOS 10.13, iOS 11, and tvOS 11 or later, the Vision framework replaces this class for identifying and analyzing image features. See `VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest`. See [`VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Vision/VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest))
The properties of a `CIFaceFeature` object provide information about the face’s eyes and mouth. A face object in a video can also have properties that track its location over time, tracking ID and frame count.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifacefeature#topics)
### [Locating Faces](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifacefeature#Locating-Faces)
[`var bounds: CGRect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifacefeature/bounds-swift.property)

[`var hasSmile: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifacefeature/hassmile-swift.property)
A Boolean value that indicates whether a smile is detected in the face.
[`var leftEyeClosed: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifacefeature/lefteyeclosed-swift.property)
A Boolean value that indicates whether a closed left eye is detected in the face.
[`var rightEyeClosed: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifacefeature/righteyeclosed-swift.property)
A Boolean value that indicates whether a closed right eye is detected in the face.
### [Tracking Distinct Faces in Video](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifacefeature#Tracking-Distinct-Faces-in-Video)
[`var hasTrackingID: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifacefeature/hastrackingid-swift.property)
A Boolean value that indicates whether the face object has a tracking ID.
[`var trackingID: Int32`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifacefeature/trackingid-swift.property)
The tracking identifier of the face object.
[`var hasTrackingFrameCount: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifacefeature/hastrackingframecount-swift.property)
