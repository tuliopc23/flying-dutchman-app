```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboarditemdataprovider#overview)
You can specify an object as a pasteboard data provider for a pasteboard item using [`NSPasteboardItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboarditem)’s [`setDataProvider(_:forTypes:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nspasteboarditem/setdataprovider\(_:fortypes:\)) method. The data provider must implement this protocol to provide data upon request.
