Structure
# Span
`Span<Element>` represents a contiguous region of memory which contains initialized instances of `Element`.

```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Span#overview)
A `Span` instance is a non-owning, non-escaping view into memory. When a `Span` is created, it inherits the lifetime of the container owning the contiguous memory, ensuring temporal safety and avoiding use-after-free errors. Operations on `Span` are bounds-checked, ensuring spatial safety and avoiding buffer overflow errors.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Span#topics)
### [Initializers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Span#Initializers)
[`init()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/span/init\(\))
### [Instance Properties](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Span#Instance-Properties)
[`var bytes: RawSpan`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/span/bytes)
[`var count: Int`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/span/count)
The number of elements in the span.
[`var indices: Range<Span<Element>.Index>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/span/indices)
The indices that are valid for subscripting the span, in ascending order.
[`var isEmpty: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/span/isempty)
A Boolean value indicating whether the span is empty.
### [Instance Methods](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Span#Instance-Methods)
[`func extracting(Range<Span<Element>.Index>) -> Span<Element>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/span/extracting\(_:\)-1c6e6)

[`func extracting(droppingFirst: Int) -> Span<Element>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/span/extracting\(droppingfirst:\))
Returns a span over all but the given number of initial elements.
[`func extracting(droppingLast: Int) -> Span<Element>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/span/extracting\(droppinglast:\))

[`func extracting(last: Int) -> Span<Element>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/span/extracting\(last:\))
Returns a span containing the final elements of the span, up to the given maximum length.
[`func extracting(unchecked: ClosedRange<Span<Element>.Index>) -> Span<Element>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/span/extracting\(unchecked:\)-46y0h)
Constructs a new span over the items within the supplied range of positions within this span.
[`func extracting(unchecked: Range<Span<Element>.Index>) -> Span<Element>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/span/extracting\(unchecked:\)-8hfj1)
Constructs a new span over the items within the supplied range of positions within this span.
[`func indices(of: borrowing Span<Element>) -> Range<Span<Element>.Index>?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/span/indices\(of:\))
Returns the indices within `self` where the memory represented by `span` is located, or `nil` if `span` is not located within `self`.
[`func isIdentical(to: Span<Element>) -> Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/span/isidentical\(to:\))
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two `Span` instances refer to the same region in memory.
[`func withUnsafeBufferPointer<E, Result>((UnsafeBufferPointer<Element>) throws(E) -> Result) throws(E) -> Result`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/span/withunsafebufferpointer\(_:\))
Calls a closure with a pointer to the viewed contiguous storage.
[`func withUnsafeBytes<E, Result>((UnsafeRawBufferPointer) throws(E) -> Result) throws(E) -> Result`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/span/withunsafebytes\(_:\))
