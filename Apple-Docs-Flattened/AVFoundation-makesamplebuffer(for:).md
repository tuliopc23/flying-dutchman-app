Instance Method
# makeSampleBuffer(for:)
Creates a sample buffer, and attempts to load its data asynchronously if requested.
iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+tvOS 16.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 9.0+
```
func makeSampleBuffer(for request: [AVSampleBufferRequest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebufferrequest)) throws -> sending [CMSampleBuffer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreMedia/CMSampleBuffer)
```

## [ Parameters ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebuffergenerator/makesamplebuffer\(for:\)#parameters) 

`request`
    
A sample buffer creation request.
## [Return Value](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebuffergenerator/makesamplebuffer\(for:\)#return-value)
A sample buffer object.
## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebuffergenerator/makesamplebuffer\(for:\)#Discussion)
If you created the generator with a `nil` timebase, any associated [`AVSampleBufferRequest`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebufferrequest) objects default to using a request mode of [`AVSampleBufferRequest.Mode.immediate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebufferrequest/mode-swift.enum/immediate).
Call the [`notifyOfDataReady(for:completionHandler:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebuffergenerator/notifyofdataready\(for:completionhandler:\)) class method to have the system notify you when sample buffer data is available.
The request may fail based on generator configuration or file format.
