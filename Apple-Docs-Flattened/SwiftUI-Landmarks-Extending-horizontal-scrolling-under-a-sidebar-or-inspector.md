Sample Code
# Landmarks: Extending horizontal scrolling under a sidebar or inspector
Improve your horizontal scrollbar’s appearance by extending it under a sidebar or inspector.

iOS 26.0+iPadOS 26.0+macOS 26.0+Xcode 26.0+
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/landmarks-extending-horizontal-scrolling-under-a-sidebar-or-inspector#Overview)
The Landmarks app lets people explore interesting sites around the world. Whether it’s a national park near their home or a far-flung location on a different continent, the app provides a way for people to organize and mark their adventures and receive custom activity badges along the way.
This sample demonstrates how to extend horizontal scrolling under a sidebar or inspector. Within each continent section in `LandmarksView`, an instance of `LandmarkHorizontalListView` shows a horizontally scrolling list of landmark views. When open, the landmark views can scroll underneath the sidebar or inspector.
![An image of the landmarks view on an iPad, with the sidebar visible and some landmarks visible under the sidebar.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/709551ab6017da3888bbb3b9b1620fed/Landmarks-Building-an-app-with-Liquid-Glass-3%402x.png)
## [Configure the scroll view](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/landmarks-extending-horizontal-scrolling-under-a-sidebar-or-inspector#Configure-the-scroll-view)
To achieve this effect, the sample configures the `LandmarkHorizontalListView` so it touches the leading and trailing edges. When a scroll view touches the sidebar or inspector, the system automatically adjusts it to scroll under the sidebar or inspector and then off the edge of the screen.
The sample adds a [`Spacer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/spacer) at the beginning of the [`ScrollView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scrollview) to inset the content so it aligns with the title padding:
```
ScrollView(.horizontal, showsIndicators: false) {
    LazyHStack(spacing: Constants.standardPadding) {
        Spacer()
            .frame(width: Constants.standardPadding)
        ForEach(landmarkList) { landmark in
            //...
        }
    }
}

```
