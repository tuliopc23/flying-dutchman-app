# Create ML Components
Create more customizable machine learning models in your app.
iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 13.0+tvOS 16.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 11.0+
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createmlcomponents#Overview)
Create ML Components is a fundamental technology that exposes the underpinnings of monolithic tasks. You’re in full control and can create custom pipelines for greater flexibility.
![A flowchart that depicts a task represented as 4 component rectangles. The flow begins in the bottom left rectangle which has a camera icon to represent an input image and a label that reads Component 0. This rectangle has two flow arrows — one points up to the single rectangle above the other three rectangles. This top rectangle has a wand and four stars icon that represents an enhancement to the image and a label that reads Component 1. The second flow arrow points to the bottom center rectangle which has a screen within a screen scaling icon that represents the resizing of the image and a label that reads Component 2. Next, the single top rectangle has a flow arrow that points down to the bottom right rectangle which has a photo icon that represents the finished image and a label that reads Component n. A series of three dots connects this rectangle to the center rectangle in the bottom row.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/eb40070181caf3b058aa089ccb01534f/create-ml-task%402x.png)
