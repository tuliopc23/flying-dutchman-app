Sample Code
# Writing fragmented MPEG-4 files for HTTP Live Streaming
Create an HTTP Live Streaming presentation by turning a movie file into a sequence of fragmented MPEG-4 files.
[ Download ](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/454a64e24941/WritingFragmentedMPEG4FilesForHTTPLiveStreaming.zip)
macOS 11.0+Xcode 12.0+
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/writing-fragmented-mpeg-4-files-for-http-live-streaming#Overview)
Note
This sample code project is associated with WWDC20 session [10011: Authoring Fragmented MPEG-4 with AVAssetWriter](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10011).
### [Configure the sample code project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/writing-fragmented-mpeg-4-files-for-http-live-streaming#Configure-the-sample-code-project)
Before you run the sample code project in Xcode:
  1. Edit the shared scheme called `fmp4Writer`.
  2. Open the Run action.
  3. Replace the _< path to movie file on disk>_ argument with the path to a movie file on your local hard drive.
  4. Replace the _< path to output directory>_ argument with your desired output directory; for example `~/Desktop/fmp4writer/`.
