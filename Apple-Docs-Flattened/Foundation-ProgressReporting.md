# ProgressReporting
An interface for objects that report progress using a single progress instance.
iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+
```
protocol ProgressReporting : [NSObjectProtocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ObjectiveC/NSObjectProtocol)
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/progressreporting#overview)
Create the returned progress object using [`ProgressReporting`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/progressreporting). The resulting object has no parent allowing the caller to add it to a progress tree using [`ProgressReporting`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/progressreporting).
You can return a single progress object or a progress tree. If you are creating a progress tree, add the children to the returned progress object as described in [Reporting Progress for Multiple Operations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/progress#Reporting-Progress-for-Multiple-Operations).
You are responsible for setting and updating the [`ProgressReporting`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/progressreporting) of any [`Progress`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/progress) object you create.
