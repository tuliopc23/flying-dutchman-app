# TN3186: Troubleshooting In-App Purchases availability in the sandbox
Identify common configurations that make your In-App Purchases unavailable in the sandbox environment.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3186-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-the-sandbox#Overview)
When testing your In-App Purchases in the Apple sandbox environment, your app may not display its products. After [submitting your In-App Purchases](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-for-review#submit-an-in-app-purchase) to App Review, they might also be missing or unresponsive during review. The sandbox environment is a test environment for testing the In-App Purchase implementation in your app with real product data from App Store Connect. TestFlight also uses the sandbox for In-App Purchases. StoreKit queries App Store Connect for this data when your app calls StoreKit APIs in the sandbox. For more information, see [Testing In-App Purchases with sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/testing-in-app-purchases-with-sandbox).
Important
Testing In-App Purchase in the Apple sandbox environment doesn’t require you submit your In-App Purchases for review. For more information, see [Explore testing In-App Purchases](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10142).
To offer In-App Purchases in your app, call [`Product.products(for:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product/products\(for:\)) with a list of [product identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/in-app-purchase-information) (`Product ID`) matching these products in the sandbox. `Product.products(for:)` returns an array that includes an instance of [`Product`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product) for each of the In-App Purchases. Update your app’s UI with these returned instances, which contain all In-App Purchase information configured in App Store Connect for your app.
If `Product.products(for:)` fails to return a `Product` instance for your products in the sandbox, validate your product identifier list and confirm you [set a price](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-in-app-purchases/set-a-price-for-an-in-app-purchase#set-a-price-for-an-in-app-purchase) and [added localizations](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-in-app-purchases/view-and-edit-in-app-purchase-information#add-and-remove-localizations) for each of the In-App Purchases.
After you complete the above checks, retry the product request. If the In-App Purchases are still missing, it may be due to the following reasons:
  * Your [bundle ID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/CFBundleIdentifier) doesn’t match the bundle ID of an app in App Store Connect.
  * Your bundle ID is disabled for the In-App Purchase capability in [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources).
  * You are using a [wildcard App ID](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/identifiers/register-an-app-id) for your app.
  * You signed your app with an invalid [certificate](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/certificates/certificates-overview) or [provisioning profile](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/provisioning-profiles/edit-download-or-delete-profiles).
  * You have an inactive [Apple Developer Program account](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships).
  * You don’t have a [Paid Apps Agreement](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-agreements/sign-and-update-agreements) in effect in App Store Connect.
  * You have incomplete or outdated [banking](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-banking-information/enter-banking-information) or [tax](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-tax-information/provide-tax-information) information in App Store Connect.


Note
If your app fails to display its products when testing In-App Purchases in Xcode, or when launching the app in the App Store, see [TN3185: Troubleshooting In-App Purchases availability in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3185-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-xcode) and [TN3188: Troubleshooting In-App Purchases availability in the App Store](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3188-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-the-app-store), respectively.
## [Validate your product identifier list](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3186-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-the-sandbox#Validate-your-product-identifier-list)
To verify your product identifier list, perform these steps:
  1. In your Xcode project, locate your app’s [bundle ID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/preparing-your-app-for-distribution#Set-the-bundle-ID).
  2. In App Store Connect, find the app that matches your app’s bundle ID.
  3. Verify each product identifier in your list matches the product identifier (`Product ID`) of an In-App Purchase created for the app in App Store Connect.


## [Identify the test environment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3186-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-the-sandbox#Identify-the-test-environment)
Apple provides test environments in Xcode and the Apple sandbox to help you verify your implementation of In-App Purchases. For more information, see [Testing at all stages of development with Xcode and the sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/testing-at-all-stages-of-development-with-xcode-and-the-sandbox).
If your Xcode project contains a [StoreKit Configuration file](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode#Create-a-StoreKit-configuration-file), ensure you are testing your In-App Purchases in the environment you wish to use. [Disable StoreKit Testing in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode#Disable-StoreKit-Testing-in-Xcode) in your Xcode project to test in the sandbox. [Enable StoreKit Testing in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode#Enable-StoreKit-Testing-in-Xcode) to test in Xcode local test environment.
## [Use a bundle ID registered in App Store Connect and enabled for In-App Purchase](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3186-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-the-sandbox#Use-a-bundle-ID-registered-in-App-Store-Connect-and-enabled-for-In-App-Purchase)
Testing your In-App Purchases in the sandbox requires that your app uses a [bundle ID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/CFBundleIdentifier) registered in App Store Connect and enabled for In-App Purchase in [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources). A bundle ID uniquely identifies your app throughout the system, for example, a bundle ID like `com.example` uniquely identifies an app using the bundle ID `com.example.myapp` and you are guaranteed that no other apps are using that same bundle ID. You register a bundle ID for your app when you [create an App Store Connect record](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-a-new-app) for the app. App Store Connect displays the registered bundle ID under the App Information section of your app. In your Xcode project, the bundle ID appears in the [Signing & Capabilities pane](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/preparing-your-app-for-distribution#Set-the-bundle-ID) of your app’s target. Confirm the bundle ID in your Xcode project matches the bundle ID you have registered for your app.
After you confirm your Xcode project uses a registered bundle ID, verify you have enabled the In-App Purchase [capability](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-capabilities-to-your-app) for the bundle ID. In the Identifiers section of [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources), select your bundle ID, scroll down to In-App Purchase under Capabilities, then confirm you have selected the capability.
Note
In Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles, you can register an explicit App ID or a wildcard App ID for your app. An explicit App ID contains the full path of a bundle ID such as `com.example`. A wildcard App ID contains an asterisk as the last part of its bundle ID search string, for example, `com.example.myapp.*`. For more information, see [Register an App ID](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/identifiers/register-an-app-id). The In-App Purchase capability appears enabled by default for an explicit App ID and disabled for a wildcard App ID. In the sandbox, you can’t test In-App Purchase with a provisioning profile that contains a wildcard App ID.
## [Sign your app with a valid certificate and provisioning profile](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3186-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-the-sandbox#Sign-your-app-with-a-valid-certificate-and-provisioning-profile)
To use In-App Purchases in your app, you must sign your app with a provisioning profile that grants the app access to the In-App Purchase capability. For more information, see [Adding capabilities to your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-capabilities-to-your-app). A provisioning profile contains App ID and capabilities information. Inspect your provisioning profile, confirm the value of App ID matches your registered [bundle ID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/CFBundleIdentifier) and capabilities includes In-App Purchase. To view the content of your provisioning profile, see [Check Your Provisioning Profile](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/diagnosing-issues-with-entitlements#Check-Your-Provisioning-Profile) in [Diagnosing Issues with Entitlements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/diagnosing-issues-with-entitlements).
Note
Provisioning profiles that contain a revoked certificate or a modified App ID are invalid and cannot be used to sign your app. If your provisioning profile is invalid or expires, sign your app updates with a [regenerated provisioning profile](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/manage-provisioning-profiles/edit-download-or-delete-profiles#regenerate-a-provisioning-profile). After you renew your developer account, sign your app updates with new or updated [certificates](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/certificates/certificates-overview) and [provisioning profiles](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/manage-provisioning-profiles/edit-download-or-delete-profiles#edit-a-provisioning-profile). If your development or distribution certificate expires or you revoke it, sign your app updates with a new certificate and updated provisioning profiles. For more information, see [Edit a provisioning profile](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/manage-provisioning-profiles/edit-download-or-delete-profiles#edit-a-provisioning-profile). After you accept and complete an app transfer, sign updates of the transferred app with new provisioning profiles.
Use [automatic signing](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev80cc24546) to allow Xcode to manage code signing for you. For more information, see [Configure code signing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/distributing-your-app-to-registered-devices#Configure-code-signing).
## [Review your Apple Developer Program membership](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3186-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-the-sandbox#Review-your-Apple-Developer-Program-membership)
To build apps with advanced capabilities such as In-App Purchase, you must have an active developer account. For more information, see [Choosing a Membership](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships). The following table lists reasons why your account might be inactive:
Reason | Solution  
---|---  
The developer account expired. | Your [Account Holder](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/access/roles) must renew membership, accept the Paid Apps Agreement again, and update tax and banking information. For more information, see [Expired memberships](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/membership/renewal).  
The most recent version of the Apple Developer Program Licence Agreement is available and unsigned. | Your [Account Holder](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/access/roles) must accept the latest version of the Apple Developer Program Licence Agreement.  
## [Ensure you have a Paid Apps Agreement in effect](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3186-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-the-sandbox#Ensure-you-have-a-Paid-Apps-Agreement-in-effect)
To offer In-App Purchases in your app, you must have a [Paid Apps Agreement](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-agreements/sign-and-update-agreements) in effect in App Store Connect. The agreement is in effect if App Store Connect shows an `Active` status in its Agreements section. For more information about the statuses, see [View agreements status](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-agreements/view-agreements-status). The following table lists reasons why your Paid Apps Agreement might not be in effect:
Reason | Solution  
---|---  
The Paid Apps Agreement is unsigned. | Your [Account Holder](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/access/roles) must sign the Paid Apps Agreement.  
The most recent version of the Paid Apps Agreement is available and unsigned. | Your [Account Holder](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/access/roles) must accept the latest version of the Paid Apps Agreement.  
The Paid Apps Agreement expires. | Your [Account Holder](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/access/roles) must renew the Paid Apps Agreement.  
## [Complete all banking and tax information](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3186-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-the-sandbox#Complete-all-banking-and-tax-information)
After you accept the [Paid Apps Agreement](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-agreements/sign-and-update-agreements), your [Account Holder](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/access/roles) needs to submit all required banking and tax information. The banking and tax information are complete if App Store Connect shows an `Active` status in its Bank Accounts and Tax Forms sections, respectively. For more information, see [Manage banking information](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-banking-information/enter-banking-information), [Manage tax information](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-tax-information/provide-tax-information), and [View agreements status](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-agreements/view-agreements-status).
After you renew the developer membership, check if your Account Holder needs to accept the Paid Apps Agreement and update the financial information again.
## [Retry your product request later](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3186-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-the-sandbox#Retry-your-product-request-later)
When you edit In-App Purchase information in App Store Connect, it can take up to 1 hour for your changes to appear in the sandbox environment. For more information, see [View and edit in-app purchase information](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-in-app-purchases/view-and-edit-in-app-purchase-information).
