# Views and Controls
Present your content onscreen and handle user input and events.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/views-and-controls#overview)
Views and controls are the building blocks of your app’s user interface.
![A sample macOS app with the view broken down into label, text field, and button control elements.The window has the title New List. Beneath the title is a text field labeled name, with a text box containing the placeholder text Enter text here. Beneath that is a label titled color followed by seven selectable circles of color. In the bottom right hand corner is a enabled Cancel button followed by a disabled OK button side-by-side.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/5493c5134f4713caea62664e3709803a/media-4098514%402x.png)
Views can host other views. Embedding one view inside another creates a containment relationship between the host view (known as the _superview_) and the embedded view (known as the _subview_). View hierarchies make it easier to manage views.
You can also use views to do any of the following:
  * Respond to touches and other events (either directly or in coordination with gesture recognizers).
  * Draw custom content using Core Graphics.
  * Respond to focus changes.
  * Animate the size, position, and appearance attributes of the view using Core Animation.


Favor AppKit views and controls whenever possible. These components adapt automatically to system changes, and many support appearance customizations to support the look and feel you want in your app. When AppKit doesn’t provide the exact view or control you need, you can create a custom view.
[`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) is the root class for all views and defines their common behavior. [`NSControl`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscontrol) defines additional behaviors that are specific to buttons, switches, and other views designed for user interactions.
For additional information about how to use views and controls, see [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/all-components).
