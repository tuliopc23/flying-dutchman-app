struct PayWithApplePayButton<Fallback> where Fallback : [View](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View)
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/paywithapplepaybutton#Overview)
Use this structure as the SwiftUI equivalent to [`PKPaymentButton`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/pkpaymentbutton). For design guidance, see Human Interface Guidelines > Apple Pay > [Using Apple Pay buttons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/apple-pay#Using-Apple-Pay-buttons).
This example shows an implementation of the Pay with Apple Pay button.
```
// Create a payment request.
@State private var paymentRequest = PKPaymentRequest()


// Create a payment authorization change method.
func paymentAuthorizationDidChange(phase: PayWithApplePayButtonPaymentAuthorizationPhase) { ... }


@ViewBuilder var payButton: some View {
    PayWithApplePayButton(
        .plain,
        request: paymentRequest,
        onPaymentAuthorizationChange: paymentAuthorizationDidChange
    ) {
        // Display a fallback view if the payment request fails.
    }
    .frame(width: 250, height: 50)
    .payWithApplePayButtonStyle(.automatic)
}

```
