# Mouse, Keyboard, and Trackpad
Handle events related to mouse, keyboard, and trackpad input.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/mouse-keyboard-and-trackpad#overview)
The [`NSResponder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder) class defines the responder chain, an ordered list of objects that respond to user events. When the user clicks the mouse button, taps on the trackpad, or presses a key, an event is generated and passed up the responder chain in search of an object that can respond to it. Any object that handles events must inherit from the [`NSResponder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder) class. The core AppKit classes, [`NSApplication`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication), [`NSWindow`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow), and [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview), inherit from [`NSResponder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder).
An [`NSApplication`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication) object maintains a list of [`NSWindow`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow) objects—one for each window belonging to the app—and each [`NSWindow`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow) object maintains a hierarchy of [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) objects. This view hierarchy is used for both drawing the user interface and for handling events.
An [`NSWindow`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow) object handles window-level events and distributes other events to its views. An [`NSWindow`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow) object also has a delegate allowing you to customize its behavior.

[`struct ModifierFlags`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsevent/modifierflags-swift.struct)
Flags that represent key states in an event object.
[`struct Phase`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsevent/phase-swift.struct)
Constants that represent the possible phases during an event phase.
[`struct SwipeTrackingOptions`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsevent/swipetrackingoptions)
