## [ Mentioned in ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arconfiguration/issupported#mentions)
[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/verifying-device-support-and-user-permission)
## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arconfiguration/issupported#Discussion)
Different types of AR experiences (which you configure using concrete [`ARConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arconfiguration) subclasses) can have different hardware requirements.
Before attempting to create an AR configuration, verify that the user’s device supports the configuration you plan to use by checking the [`isSupported`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arconfiguration/issupported) property of the corresponding configuration class. If this property’s value is [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/false), the current device does not support the requested configuration.
Important
All ARKit configurations require an iOS device with an A9 or later processor. If your app otherwise supports other devices and offers augmented reality as a secondary feature, use this property to determine whether to offer AR-based features to the user.
If your app requires ARKit for its core functionality, use the `arkit` key in the [`UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities) section of your app’s Info.plist to make your app available only on devices that support ARKit.
