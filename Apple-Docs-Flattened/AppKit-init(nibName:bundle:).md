Initializer
# init(nibName:bundle:)
Returns a view controller object initialized to the nib file in the specified bundle.
macOS 10.5+
```
@[MainActor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/MainActor)
init(
    nibName nibNameOrNil: [NSNib](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsnib).[Name](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsnib/name)?,
    bundle nibBundleOrNil: [Bundle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/Bundle)?
)
```

## [ Parameters ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSViewController/init\(nibName:bundle:\)#parameters) 

`nibNameOrNil`
    
The name of the nib file, without any leading path information. 

`nibBundleOrNil`
    
The bundle in which to search for the nib file. If you specify `nil`, this method looks for the nib file in the main bundle.
## [Return Value](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSViewController/init\(nibName:bundle:\)#return-value)
The initialized [`NSViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsviewcontroller) object.
## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSViewController/init\(nibName:bundle:\)#Discussion)
The [`NSViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsviewcontroller) object looks for the nib file in the bundle’s language-specific project directories first, followed by the Resources directory.
The specified nib file should typically have the class of the file’s owner set to [`NSViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsviewcontroller), or a custom subclass, with the `view` outlet connected to a view.
If you pass in `nil` for `nibNameOrNil`, [`nibName`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsviewcontroller/nibname) returns `nil` and [`loadView()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsviewcontroller/loadview\(\)) throws an exception; in this case you must set [`view`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsviewcontroller/view) before [`view`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsviewcontroller/view) is invoked, or override [`loadView()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsviewcontroller/loadview\(\)).

[`func loadView()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsviewcontroller/loadview\(\))
Instantiates a view from a nib file and sets the value of the [`view`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsviewcontroller/view) property.
