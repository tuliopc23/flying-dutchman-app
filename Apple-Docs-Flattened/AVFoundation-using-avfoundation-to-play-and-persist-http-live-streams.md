# Using AVFoundation to play and persist HTTP live streams
Play HTTP Live Streams and persist streams on disk for offline playback using AVFoundation.
[ Download ](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/24fb505506c6/UsingAVFoundationToPlayAndPersistHTTPLiveStreams.zip)
iOS 18.0+iPadOS 18.0+Xcode 16.0+
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/using-avfoundation-to-play-and-persist-http-live-streams#Overview)
This sample provides a catalog of HTTP Live Streams (HLS) that you can play by tapping the row in the table corresponding to the stream. To manage the download of a stream, tap the button associated with the stream in the table. Tapping the button causes a transition to a new view controller which provides an interface to initiate a download, cancel an already running download, or delete a downloaded stream from the device.
The sample creates and initializes an [`AVAssetDownloadConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avassetdownloadconfiguration) and creates a [`AVAssetDownloadTask`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avassetdownloadtask) using the download configuration for the download of a stream. The example shows how to set a primary [`AVAssetDownloadContentConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avassetdownloadcontentconfiguration) and at least one auxiliary content configuration to be downloaded.
Note
This sample doesn’t support saving FairPlay Streaming (FPS) content. For a version of the sample that demonstrates how to download FPS content, see [FairPlay Streaming Server SDK](https://developer.apple.com/streaming/fps/).
### [Configure the sample code project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/using-avfoundation-to-play-and-persist-http-live-streams#Configure-the-sample-code-project)
Build and run the sample on an actual device or a simulator device running iOS 15 or later.
If you want to add your own streams to test with this sample, add an entry into the `Streams.plist` file in the Xcode project. There are two important keys you need to provide values for: 

`name`
    
The display name of the HLS stream in the sample. 

`playlist_url`
    
The URL of the HLS stream’s master playlist.
If any of the streams you add aren’t hosted securely, you’ll need to add an Application Transport Security (ATS) exception in the `Info.plist` file in the Xcode project. For more information on ATS and the relevant property list keys see [`NSAppTransportSecurity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/NSAppTransportSecurity)
### [Play a stream](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/using-avfoundation-to-play-and-persist-http-live-streams#Play-a-stream)
To play an item, tap one of the rows in the table. Tapping the item causes a transition to a new view controller. As part of that transition, the table view creates an `AssetPlaybackManager` and assigns the appropriate asset to it, as shown in the following example:
```
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
    super.prepare(for: segue, sender: sender)


    if segue.identifier == AssetListTableViewController.presentPlayerViewControllerSegueID {
        guard let cell = sender as? AssetListTableViewCell,
            let playerViewControler = segue.destination as? AVPlayerViewController else { return }


        /*
         Grab a reference for the destinationViewController to use in later delegate callbacks from
         AssetPlaybackManager.
         */
        playerViewController = playerViewControler


        // Load the new Asset to playback into AssetPlaybackManager.
        AssetPlaybackManager.sharedManager.setAssetForPlayback(cell.asset)
    }
}

```

Assigning an asset to the `AssetPlaybackManager` causes it to create an `AVPlayerItem` for the asset, removing any previous asset in the process:
```
private var asset: Asset? {
    willSet {
        /// Remove any previous KVO observer.
        guard let urlAssetObserver = urlAssetObserver else { return }
        
        urlAssetObserver.invalidate()
    }
    
    didSet {
        if let asset {
            Task {
                do {
                    if try await asset.urlAsset.load(.isPlayable) {
                        playerItem = AVPlayerItem(asset: asset.urlAsset)
                        player.replaceCurrentItem(with: playerItem)
                    } else {
                        // The asset isn't playable, so reset the player state.
                        resetPlayer()
                    }
                } catch {
                    logger.error("Unable to load `isPlayable` property.")
                }
            }
        } else {
            resetPlayer()
        }
    }
}

```

The `AssetPlaybackManager` uses KVO to monitor the `AVPlayerItem` object’s `status` and initiates playback when the `status` becomes ready to play:
```
playerItemObserver = playerItem?.observe(\AVPlayerItem.status, options: [.new, .initial]) { [weak self] (item, _) in
    guard let strongSelf = self else { return }
    
    if item.status == .readyToPlay {
        if !strongSelf.readyForPlayback {
            strongSelf.readyForPlayback = true
            strongSelf.delegate?.streamPlaybackManager(strongSelf, playerReadyToPlay: strongSelf.player)
        }
    } else if item.status == .failed {
        let error = item.error
        
        logger.error("Error: \(String(describing: error?.localizedDescription))")
    }

```

### [Download a stream](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/using-avfoundation-to-play-and-persist-http-live-streams#Download-a-stream)
When the person initiates a download by tapping the button in the corresponding stream’s table view cell, an instance of `AssetPersistenceManager` calls the following function to create an `AVAssetDownloadTask` object with an `AVAssetDownloadConfiguration` to download multiple [`AVMediaSelection`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avmediaselection) for the [`AVURLAsset`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avurlasset) of the stream:
```
func downloadStream(for asset: Asset) async throws {


    // Get the default media selections for the asset's media selection groups.
    let preferredMediaSelection = try await asset.urlAsset.load(.preferredMediaSelection)


    /*
     Creates and initializes an `AVAssetDownloadTask` using an `AVAssetDownloadConfiguration` to download multiple `AVMediaSelections`
     on an `AVURLAsset`.
     The `primaryContentConfiguration` in `AVAssetDownloadConfiguration` requests for a variant with bitrate greater than one of the
     lower bitrate variants in the asset.
     */
    let config = AVAssetDownloadConfiguration(asset: asset.urlAsset, title: asset.stream.name)
    /// Primary content configuration setup.
    let primaryQualifier = AVAssetVariantQualifier(predicate: NSPredicate(format: "peakBitRate > 265000"))
    config.primaryContentConfiguration.variantQualifiers = [primaryQualifier]
    
    /// Creation of `AVAssetDownloadTask` with the above configured `AVAssetDownloadConfiguration`.
    let task = assetDownloadURLSession.makeAssetDownloadTask(downloadConfiguration: config)


    /// To better track the `AVAssetDownloadTask`, set the `taskDescription` to something unique for the sample.
    task.taskDescription = asset.stream.name


    activeDownloadsMap[task] = asset
    
    /// Use `task.progress` value to provide download progress updates in the UI.
    let progressObservation: NSKeyValueObservation = task.progress.observe(\.fractionCompleted) { progress, _ in
        Task { @MainActor in
            var userInfo = [String: Any]()
            userInfo[Asset.Keys.name] = asset.stream.name
            userInfo[Asset.Keys.percentDownloaded] = progress.fractionCompleted
            NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .AssetDownloadProgress, object: nil, userInfo: userInfo)
        }
    }
    self.progressObservers.append(progressObservation)


    task.resume()


    var userInfo = [String: Any]()
    userInfo[Asset.Keys.name] = asset.stream.name
    userInfo[Asset.Keys.downloadState] = Asset.DownloadState.downloading.rawValue
    userInfo[Asset.Keys.downloadSelectionDisplayName] = await displayNamesForSelectedMediaOptions(preferredMediaSelection)


    NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .AssetDownloadStateChanged, object: nil, userInfo: userInfo)
}

```

Note
You can’t save an HTTP Live Stream while it’s in progress. If you try to save a live stream, the system throws an exception. Only Video On Demand (VOD) streams support offline playback.
### [Cancel an in-progress download](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/using-avfoundation-to-play-and-persist-http-live-streams#Cancel-an-in-progress-download)
Tap the button in the corresponding stream’s table view cell to reveal the accessory view, then tap Cancel to stop downloading the stream. The following function in `AssetPersistenceManager` cancels the download by calling the `URLSessionTask` [`cancel()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/URLSessionTask/cancel\(\)) method.
```
func cancelDownload(for asset: Asset) {
    var task: AVAssetDownloadTask?


    for (taskKey, assetVal) in activeDownloadsMap where asset == assetVal {
        task = taskKey
        break
    }


    task?.cancel()
}

```

### [Remove a downloaded stream from disk](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/using-avfoundation-to-play-and-persist-http-live-streams#Remove-a-downloaded-stream-from-disk)
Tap the button in the corresponding stream’s table view cell to reveal the accessory view, then tap Delete to delete the downloaded stream file. The following function in `AssetPersistenceManager` removes a downloaded stream on the device. First the asset URL corresponding to the file on the device is identified, then the `FileManager` [`removeItem(at:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/FileManager/removeItem\(at:\)) method is called to remove the downloaded stream at the specified URL.
```
func deleteAsset(_ asset: Asset) {
    let userDefaults = UserDefaults.standard


    do {
        if let localFileLocation = localAssetForStream(withName: asset.stream.name)?.urlAsset.url {
            try FileManager.default.removeItem(at: localFileLocation)


            userDefaults.removeObject(forKey: asset.stream.name)


            var userInfo = [String: Any]()
            userInfo[Asset.Keys.name] = asset.stream.name
            userInfo[Asset.Keys.downloadState] = Asset.DownloadState.notDownloaded.rawValue


            NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .AssetDownloadStateChanged, object: nil,
                                            userInfo: userInfo)
        }
    } catch {
        logger.error("An error occured deleting the file: \(error)")
    }
}

```

### [Measure playback performance](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/using-avfoundation-to-play-and-persist-http-live-streams#Measure-playback-performance)
Note
You can view the various performance indicators in the console during playback.
For example, here’s the code to calculate the total time spent playing the stream, obtained from the `AVPlayerItemAccessLog`:
```
var totalDurationWatched: Double {
    // Compute total duration watched by iterating through the AccessLog events.
    var totalDurationWatched = 0.0
    if accessLog != nil && !accessLog!.events.isEmpty {
        for event in accessLog!.events where event.durationWatched > 0 {
                totalDurationWatched += event.durationWatched
        }
    }
    return totalDurationWatched
}

```
