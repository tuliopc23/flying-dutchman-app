# AVCapturePhotoOutputReadinessCoordinator
An object that monitors changes to a photo output’s capture readiness.
iOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+Mac Catalyst 17.0+macOS 14.0+tvOS 17.0+
```
class AVCapturePhotoOutputReadinessCoordinator
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutputreadinesscoordinator#overview)
Use this object to coordinate user interface updates on the main queue with a [`AVCapturePhotoOutput`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutput) that runs on a background queue. Adopt the [`AVCapturePhotoOutputReadinessCoordinatorDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutputreadinesscoordinatordelegate) protocol in your app and set its implementation as the coordinator’s delegate object to receive callbacks as the associated photo output’s [`captureReadiness`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutput/capturereadiness-swift.property) state changes.
You can track additional capture requests with this object by calling its [`startTrackingCaptureRequest(using:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutputreadinesscoordinator/starttrackingcapturerequest\(using:\)) method. You can use it to synchronously update shutter button availability and appearance and on the main thread while calling the photo output’s [`capturePhoto(with:delegate:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutput/capturephoto\(with:delegate:\)) method asynchronously on a background queue.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutputreadinesscoordinator#topics)
### [Creating a coordinator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutputreadinesscoordinator#Creating-a-coordinator)
[`init(photoOutput: AVCapturePhotoOutput)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutputreadinesscoordinator/init\(photooutput:\))
Creates an object that helps coordinate user interface changes with a photo output that runs on a background queue.
### [Setting the delegate object](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutputreadinesscoordinator#Setting-the-delegate-object)
[`var delegate: (any AVCapturePhotoOutputReadinessCoordinatorDelegate)?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutputreadinesscoordinator/delegate)
The coordinator’s delegate object.
### [Performing tracking requests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutputreadinesscoordinator#Performing-tracking-requests)
[`func startTrackingCaptureRequest(using: AVCapturePhotoSettings)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutputreadinesscoordinator/starttrackingcapturerequest\(using:\))
Tracks a capture request that uses the specified photo settings.
[`func stopTrackingCaptureRequest(using: Int64)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutputreadinesscoordinator/stoptrackingcapturerequest\(using:\))
Stop tracking the capture request represented by the specified photo setting’s unique identifier.
### [Determining readiness for capture](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutputreadinesscoordinator#Determining-readiness-for-capture)
[`var captureReadiness: AVCapturePhotoOutput.CaptureReadiness`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephotooutputreadinesscoordinator/capturereadiness)
A value that indicates whether the coordinator’s photo output is ready to respond to new capture requests in a timely manner.
