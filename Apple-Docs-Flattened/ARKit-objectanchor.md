```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/objectanchor#overview)
You use object anchors to learn about the position and orientation of a real-world object.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/objectanchor#topics)
### [Inspecting an object anchor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/objectanchor#Inspecting-an-object-anchor)
[`var boundingBox: ObjectAnchor.AxisAlignedBoundingBox`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/objectanchor/boundingbox)
The bounding box of an anchor.
[`struct AxisAlignedBoundingBox`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/objectanchor/axisalignedboundingbox)
Values that describe an axis-aligned bounding box.
[`var description: String`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/objectanchor/description)
A textual representation of this anchor.
[`var isTracked: Bool`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/objectanchor/istracked)
A Boolean value that indicates whether the framework is currently tracking an object anchor.
[`var originFromAnchorTransform: simd_float4x4`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/objectanchor/originfromanchortransform)
The transform from the object anchor to the origin coordinate system.
[`var referenceObject: ReferenceObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/objectanchor/referenceobject)
The reference object that an anchor corresponds to.
[`var inputFile: URL?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/referenceobject/inputfile)
The input file the framework uses for loading a reference object.
[`var usdzFile: URL?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/referenceobject/usdzfile)
The trained USDZ file, if the reference object includes one.
[`struct ReferenceObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/referenceobject)
An object the framework can track.
### [Inspecting and comparing anchors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/objectanchor#Inspecting-and-comparing-anchors)
[`var id: UUID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/objectanchor/id-swift.property)
