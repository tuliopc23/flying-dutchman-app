# Touches, presses, and gestures
Encapsulate your app’s event-handling logic in gesture recognizers so that you can reuse that code throughout your app.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/touches-presses-and-gestures#overview)
If you build your apps using standard UIKit views and controls, UIKit automatically handles touch events (including Multitouch events) for you. However, if you use custom views to display your content, you must handle all touch events that occur in your views. There are two ways to handle touch events yourself.
  * Use gesture recognizers to track the touches; see [Handling UIKit gestures](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/handling-uikit-gestures).
  * Track the touches directly in your [`UIView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview) subclass; see [Handling touches in your view](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/handling-touches-in-your-view).
