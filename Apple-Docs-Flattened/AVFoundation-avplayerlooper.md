# AVPlayerLooper
An object that loops media content using a queue player.

```
class AVPlayerLooper
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayerlooper#overview)
You can manually implement looping playback in your app using [`AVQueuePlayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avqueueplayer), but `AVPlayerLooper` provides a much simpler interface to loop a single [`AVPlayerItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayeritem). You create a player looper by passing it a reference to your [`AVQueuePlayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avqueueplayer) and a template [`AVPlayerItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayeritem) and the looper automatically manages the looping playback of this content (see example).
```
let asset = // AVAsset with its 'duration' property value loaded
let playerItem = AVPlayerItem(asset: asset)
 
// Create a new player looper with the queue player and template item
playerLooper = AVPlayerLooper(player: queuePlayer, templateItem: playerItem)
 
// Begin looping playback
queuePlayer.play()

```

Creates a player looper that continuously plays the full duration of a player item while adhering to the specified ordering of existing items in the queue.
[`convenience init(player: AVQueuePlayer, templateItem: AVPlayerItem)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayerlooper/init\(player:templateitem:\))
Creates a player looper that continuously plays the full duration of a player item.
[`convenience init(player: AVQueuePlayer, templateItem: AVPlayerItem, timeRange: CMTimeRange)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayerlooper/init\(player:templateitem:timerange:\))
Creates a player looper that continuously plays the specified time range of a player item.
### [Configuring looping](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayerlooper#Configuring-looping)
[`var loopingPlayerItems: [AVPlayerItem]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayerlooper/loopingplayeritems)

[`func disableLooping()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayerlooper/disablelooping\(\))
Disables looping for the player queue.
### [Observing looping state](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayerlooper#Observing-looping-state)
[`var loopCount: Int`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayerlooper/loopcount)
The number of times the object played the media.
[`var status: AVPlayerLooper.Status`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayerlooper/status-swift.property)
A status that indicates the object’s ability to loop playback.
[`enum Status`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayerlooper/status-swift.enum)
Status constants that indicate whether a looper can successfully perform looping playback.
### [Monitoring errors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayerlooper#Monitoring-errors)
[`var error: (any Error)?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayerlooper/error)
An error that describes the reason looping failed.
