## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel#overview)
The `SystemLanguageModel` refers to the on-device text foundation model that powers Apple Intelligence. Use [`default`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/default) to access the base version of the model and perform general-purpose text generation tasks. To access a specialized version of the model, initialize the model with [`SystemLanguageModel.UseCase`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/usecase) to perform tasks like [`contentTagging`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/usecase/contenttagging).
Verify the model availability before you use the model. Model availability depends on device factors like:
  * The device must support Apple Intelligence.
  * Apple Intelligence must be turned on in Settings.


Use [`SystemLanguageModel.Availability`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/systemlanguagemodel/availability-swift.enum) to change what your app shows to people based on the availability condition:
```
struct GenerativeView: View {
    // Create a reference to the system language model.
    private var model = SystemLanguageModel.default


    var body: some View {
        switch model.availability {
        case .available:
            // Show your intelligence UI.
        case .unavailable(.deviceNotEligible):
            // Show an alternative UI.
        case .unavailable(.appleIntelligenceNotEnabled):
            // Ask the person to turn on Apple Intelligence.
        case .unavailable(.modelNotReady):
            // The model isn't ready because it's downloading or because
            // of other system reasons.
        case .unavailable(let other):
            // The model is unavailable for an unknown reason.
        }
    }
}

```
