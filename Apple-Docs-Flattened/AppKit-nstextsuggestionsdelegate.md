Returns a new text suggestions delegate of a different, but `Hashable` suggestion item type with the items and behaviors of the receiving delegate and `other` concatenated. When the returned delegate is connected to a text field, all suggestion items provided from the first suggestions delegate appear before all those from the second suggestions delegate, visually separated by a separator.
