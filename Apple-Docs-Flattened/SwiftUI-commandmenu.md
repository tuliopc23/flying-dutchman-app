Structure
# CommandMenu
Command menus are stand-alone, top-level containers for controls that perform related, app-specific commands.
iOS 14.0+iPadOS 14.0+Mac Catalyst 14.0+macOS 11.0+visionOS 1.0+
```
struct CommandMenu<Content> where Content : [View](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view)
```

[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/building-and-customizing-the-menu-bar-with-swiftui)
[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/grouping-data-with-lazy-stack-views)
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/commandmenu#overview)
Command menus are realized as menu bar menus on macOS, inserted between the built-in View and Window menus in order of declaration. On iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS, SwiftUI creates key commands for each of a menu’s commands that has a keyboard shortcut.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/commandmenu#topics)
### [Creating a command menu](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/commandmenu#Creating-a-command-menu)
[`init(_:content:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/commandmenu/init\(_:content:\))
Creates a new menu with a localized name for a collection of app- specific commands, inserted in the standard location for app menus (after the View menu, in order with other menus declared without an explicit location).

## [See Also](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/commandmenu#see-also)
### [Defining commands](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/commandmenu#Defining-commands)
[`func commands<Content>(content: () -> Content) -> some Scene`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scene/commands\(content:\))
Adds commands to the scene.
[`func commandsRemoved() -> some Scene`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scene/commandsremoved\(\))
Removes all commands defined by the modified scene.
[`func commandsReplaced<Content>(content: () -> Content) -> some Scene`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scene/commandsreplaced\(content:\))
Replaces all commands defined by the modified scene with the commands from the builder.
[`protocol Commands`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/commands)
Conforming types represent a group of related commands that can be exposed to the user via the main menu on macOS and key commands on iOS.
[`struct CommandGroup`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/commandgroup)
Groups of controls that you can add to existing command menus.
[`struct CommandsBuilder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/commandsbuilder)
Constructs command sets from multi-expression closures. Like `ViewBuilder`, it supports up to ten expressions in the closure body.
[`struct CommandGroupPlacement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/commandgroupplacement)
The standard locations that you can place new command groups relative to.
