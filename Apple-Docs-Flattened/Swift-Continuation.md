Structure
# AsyncStream.Continuation
A mechanism to interface between synchronous code and an asynchronous stream.

```
struct Continuation
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/AsyncStream/Continuation#overview)
The closure you provide to the `AsyncStream` in `init(_:bufferingPolicy:_:)` receives an instance of this type when invoked. Use this continuation to provide elements to the stream by calling one of the `yield` methods, then terminate the stream normally by calling the `finish()` method.
Note
Unlike other continuations in Swift, `AsyncStream.Continuation` supports escaping.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/AsyncStream/Continuation#topics)
### [Producing Elements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/AsyncStream/Continuation#Producing-Elements)
[`func yield(sending Element) -> AsyncStream<Element>.Continuation.YieldResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncstream/continuation/yield\(_:\))
Resume the task awaiting the next iteration point by having it return normally from its suspension point with a given element.
[`func yield(with: sending Result<Element, Never>) -> AsyncStream<Element>.Continuation.YieldResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncstream/continuation/yield\(with:\))
Resume the task awaiting the next iteration point by having it return normally from its suspension point with a given result’s success value.
[`func yield() -> AsyncStream<Element>.Continuation.YieldResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncstream/continuation/yield\(\))
Resume the task awaiting the next iteration point by having it return normally from its suspension point.
[`enum YieldResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncstream/continuation/yieldresult)
A type that indicates the result of yielding a value to a client, by way of the continuation.
### [Finishing the Stream](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/AsyncStream/Continuation#Finishing-the-Stream)
[`func finish()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncstream/continuation/finish\(\))
Resume the task awaiting the next iteration point by having it return nil, which signifies the end of the iteration.
### [Handling Termination](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/AsyncStream/Continuation#Handling-Termination)
[`var onTermination: ((AsyncStream<Element>.Continuation.Termination) -> Void)?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncstream/continuation/ontermination)
A callback to invoke when canceling iteration of an asynchronous stream.
[`enum Termination`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncstream/continuation/termination)
A type that indicates how the stream terminated.
### [Enumerations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/AsyncStream/Continuation#Enumerations)
[`enum BufferingPolicy`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncstream/continuation/bufferingpolicy)
A strategy that handles exhaustion of a buffer’s capacity.

### [Conforms To](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/AsyncStream/Continuation#conforms-to)
  * [`Copyable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/copyable)
Conforms when `Element` conforms to `Copyable` and `Escapable`.
  * [`Equatable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/equatable)
Conforms when `Element` conforms to `Copyable` and `Escapable`.
  * [`Hashable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/hashable)
Conforms when `Element` conforms to `Copyable` and `Escapable`.
  * [`Sendable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sendable)
  * [`SendableMetatype`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sendablemetatype)

### [Creating a Continuation-Based Stream](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/AsyncStream/Continuation#Creating-a-Continuation-Based-Stream)
[`init(Element.Type, bufferingPolicy: AsyncStream<Element>.Continuation.BufferingPolicy, (AsyncStream<Element>.Continuation) -> Void)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncstream/init\(_:bufferingpolicy:_:\))
Constructs an asynchronous stream for an element type, using the specified buffering policy and element-producing closure.
[`enum BufferingPolicy`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncstream/continuation/bufferingpolicy)
A strategy that handles exhaustion of a buffer’s capacity.
