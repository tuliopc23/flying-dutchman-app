Sample Code
# Calling APIs Across Language Boundaries
Use a variety of C++ APIs in Swift – and vice-versa – across multiple targets and frameworks in an Xcode project.
[ Download ](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/8225a505ecd3/CallingAPIsAcrossLanguageBoundaries.zip)
macOS 14.0+Xcode 15.0+
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/callingapisacrosslanguageboundaries#Overview)
Note
This sample code project is associated with WWDC 2023 sessions 10172: [Mix Swift and C++](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10172) and 10268: [Meet mergeable libraries](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10268).
### [Configure the sample code project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/callingapisacrosslanguageboundaries#Configure-the-sample-code-project)
Before you run the sample code project in Xcode, ensure you’re using macOS 14.0 or later.
