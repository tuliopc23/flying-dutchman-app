Instance Property
# userInfo
The user information dictionary associated with the notification.
iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+
```
var userInfo: [[AnyHashable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/AnyHashable) : Any]? { get }
```

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSNotification/userInfo#Discussion)
In Objective-C, this may be `nil`.
The user information dictionary stores any additional objects that objects receiving the notification might use.
For example, in AppKit, [`NSControl`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSControl) objects post the [`textDidChangeNotification`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSControl/textDidChangeNotification) whenever the field editor (an [`NSText`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSText) object) changes text inside the `NSControl`. This notification provides the `NSControl` object as the notification’s associated object. In order to provide access to the field editor, the `NSControl` object posting the notification adds the field editor to the notification’s user information dictionary. Objects receiving the notification can access the field editor and the `NSControl` object posting the notification as follows:
```
func controlTextDidChange(_ notification: Notification) {
    if let fieldEditor = notification.userInfo?["NSFieldEditor"] as? NSText,
        let postingObject = notification.object as? NSControl {
        // work with the field editor and posting object
    }
}

```
