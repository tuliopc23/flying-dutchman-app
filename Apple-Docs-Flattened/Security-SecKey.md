## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/SecKey#overview)
A [`SecKey`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/seckey) instance that represents a key that is stored in a keychain can be safely cast to a [`SecKeychainItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/seckeychainitem) for manipulation as a keychain item. On the other hand, if the key is not stored in a keychain, casting the object to a [`SecKeychainItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/seckeychainitem) and passing it to Keychain Services functions returns errors.
