Instance Method
# copyMemory(from:byteCount:)
Copies the specified number of bytes from the given raw pointer’s memory into this pointer’s memory.
iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.10+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+
```
func copyMemory(
    from source: [UnsafeRawPointer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/unsaferawpointer),
    byteCount: [Int](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/int)
)
```

## [ Parameters ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/UnsafeMutableRawPointer/copyMemory\(from:byteCount:\)#parameters) 

`source`
    
A pointer to the memory to copy bytes from. The memory in the region `source..<(source + byteCount)` must be initialized to a trivial type. 

`byteCount`
    
The number of bytes to copy. `byteCount` must not be negative.
## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/UnsafeMutableRawPointer/copyMemory\(from:byteCount:\)#discussion)
If the `byteCount` bytes of memory referenced by this pointer are bound to a type `T`, then `T` must be a trivial type, this pointer and `source` must be properly aligned for accessing `T`, and `byteCount` must be a multiple of `MemoryLayout<T>.stride`.
The memory in the region `source..<(source + byteCount)` may overlap with the memory referenced by this pointer.
After calling `copyMemory(from:byteCount:)`, the `byteCount` bytes of memory referenced by this pointer are initialized to raw bytes. If the memory is bound to type `T`, then it contains values of type `T`.
Current page is copyMemory(from:byteCount:)
