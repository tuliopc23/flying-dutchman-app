## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/FoundationModels/Generable#overview)
Annotate your Swift structure or enumeration with the `Generable` macro to allow the model to respond to prompts by generating an instance of your type. Use the `Guide` macro to provide natural language descriptions of your properties, and programmatically control the values that the model can generate.
```
@Generable
struct SearchSuggestions {
    @Guide(description: "A list of suggested search terms.", .count(4))
    var searchTerms: [SearchTerm]
    @Generable
    struct SearchTerm {
        // Use a generation identifier for data structures the framework generates.
        var id: GenerationID
        @Guide(description: "A two- or three- word search term, like 'Beautiful sunsets'.")
        var searchTerm: String
    }
}

```

For every [`Generable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/generable) type in a request, the framework converts its type and format information to a JSON schema and provides it to the model. This contributes to the available context window size. If the [`LanguageModelSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/languagemodelsession) exceeds the available context size, it throws [`LanguageModelSession.GenerationError.exceededContextWindowSize(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/languagemodelsession/generationerror/exceededcontextwindowsize\(_:\)). To reduce the size of your generable type:
  * Reduce the complexity of your [`Generable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/generable) type by evaluating whether properties are necessary to complete the task.
  * Give your properties short and clear names.
  * Use [`Guide(description:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/guide\(description:\)) on properties only when it improves response quality.
  * Add a [`Guide(description:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/guide\(description:_:\)) with [`maximumCount(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/generationguide/maximumcount\(_:\)) to reduce token usage.


If the [`Generable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/generable) type includes properties with clear names the model may have all it needs to generate your type, eliminating the need of [`Guide(description:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/guide\(description:\)). For more information on managing the context window size, see [TN3193: Managing the on-device foundation model’s context window](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Technotes/tn3193-managing-the-on-device-foundation-model-s-context-window).
