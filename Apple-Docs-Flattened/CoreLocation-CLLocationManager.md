## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager#overview)
A [`CLLocationManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager) object is the central place to manage your app’s location-related behaviors. Use a location-manager object to configure, start, and stop location services. You might use these services to:
  * Track large or small changes in the user’s current location with a configurable degree of accuracy.
  * Report heading changes from the onboard compass.
  * Monitor geographical regions of interest and generate events when someone enters or leaves those regions.
  * Report the range to nearby Bluetooth beacons.


Create one or more location-manager objects in your app and use them where you need location data. After you create a location-manager object, configure it so that Core Location knows how often to report location changes. In particular, configure the [`distanceFilter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/distancefilter) and [`desiredAccuracy`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/desiredaccuracy) properties with values that reflect your app’s needs.
A [`CLLocationManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager) object reports all location-related updates to its [`delegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/delegate) object, which is an object that conforms to the [`CLLocationManagerDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanagerdelegate) protocol. Assign the delegate immediately when you configure your location manager, because the system reports the app’s authorization status to the delegate’s [`locationManagerDidChangeAuthorization(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanagerdelegate/locationmanagerdidchangeauthorization\(_:\)) method after the location manager finishes initializing itself. Core Location calls the methods of your delegate object using the [`RunLoop`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/RunLoop) of the thread on which you initialized the [`CLLocationManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager) object. That thread must itself have an active [`RunLoop`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/RunLoop), like the one found in your app’s main thread.
For more information, see [Configuring your app to use location services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/configuring-your-app-to-use-location-services).
