## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview#overview)
You typically don’t use [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) objects directly. Instead, you use objects that descend from [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) or you subclass [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) yourself and override its methods to implement the behavior you need. An instance of the [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) class (or one of its subclasses) is commonly known as a view object, or simply as a view.
Views handle the presentation and interaction with your app’s visible content. You arrange one or more views inside an [`NSWindow`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow) object, which acts as a wrapper for your content. A view object defines a rectangular region for drawing and receiving mouse events. Views handle other chores as well, including the dragging of icons and working with the [`NSScrollView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsscrollview) class to support efficient scrolling.
AppKit handles most of your app’s [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) management. Unless you’re implementing a concrete subclass of [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) or working intimately with the content of the view hierarchy at runtime, you don’t need to know much about this class’s interface. For any view, there are many methods that you can use as-is. The following methods are commonly used.
  * [`frame`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/frame) returns the location and size of the [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) object.
  * [`bounds`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/bounds) returns the internal origin and size of the [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) object.
  * [`needsDisplay`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/needsdisplay) determines whether the [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) object needs to be redrawn.
  * [`window`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/window) returns the [`NSWindow`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow) object that contains the [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) object.
  * [`draw(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/draw\(_:\)) draws the [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) object. (All subclasses must implement this method, but it’s rarely invoked explicitly.) An alternative to drawing is to update the layer directly using the [`updateLayer()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/updatelayer\(\)) method.


For more information on how `NSView` instances handle event and action messages, see [Cocoa Event Handling Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000060i). For more information on displaying tooltips and contextual menus, see [Displaying Contextual Menus](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsmenu#Displaying-Contextual-Menus) and [Managing Tooltips](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow#Managing-Tooltips).
### [Subclassing notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview#Subclassing-notes)
`NSView` is perhaps the most important class in AppKit when it comes to subclassing and inheritance. Most user-interface objects you see in a Cocoa application are objects that inherit from `NSView`. If you want to create an object that draws itself in a special way, or that responds to mouse clicks in a special way, you would create a custom subclass of `NSView` (or of a class that inherits from `NSView`). Subclassing `NSView` is such a common and important procedure that several technical documents describe how to both draw in custom subclasses and respond to events in custom subclasses. See [Cocoa Drawing Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaDrawingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003290) and [Cocoa Event Handling Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000060i) (especially “[Handling Mouse Events](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/HandlingMouseEvents/HandlingMouseEvents.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000060i-CH6)” and “[Mouse Events](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/EventObjectsTypes/EventObjectsTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000060i-CH4-SW10)”).
#### [Handling events in your subclass](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview#Handling-events-in-your-subclass)
If you subclass [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) directly and handle specific types of events, don’t call `super` in the implementations of your event-related methods. Views inherit their event-handling capabilities from their [`NSResponder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder) parent class. The default behavior for responders is to pass events up the responder chain, which isn’t the behavior you typically want for a custom view. Therefore, don’t call `super` if your view implements any of the following methods and handles the event:
  * [`mouseDown(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/mousedown\(with:\))
  * [`mouseDragged(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/mousedragged\(with:\))
  * [`mouseUp(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/mouseup\(with:\))
  * [`mouseMoved(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/mousemoved\(with:\))
  * [`mouseEntered(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/mouseentered\(with:\))
  * [`mouseExited(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/mouseexited\(with:\))
  * [`rightMouseDragged(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/rightmousedragged\(with:\))
  * [`rightMouseUp(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/rightmouseup\(with:\))
  * [`otherMouseDown(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/othermousedown\(with:\))
  * [`otherMouseDragged(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/othermousedragged\(with:\))
  * [`otherMouseUp(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/othermouseup\(with:\))
  * [`scrollWheel(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/scrollwheel\(with:\))
  * [`keyDown(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/keydown\(with:\))
  * [`keyUp(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/keyup\(with:\))
  * [`flagsChanged(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/flagschanged\(with:\))
  * [`tabletPoint(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/tabletpoint\(with:\))
  * [`tabletProximity(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/tabletproximity\(with:\))


Note
`NSView` changes the default behavior of [`rightMouseDown(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/rightmousedown\(with:\)) so that it calls [`menu(for:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/menu\(for:\)) and, if non `nil`, presents the contextual menu. In macOS 10.7 and later, if the event is not handled, `NSView` passes the event up the responder chain. Because of these behaviorial changes, call `super` when implementing [`rightMouseDown(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/rightmousedown\(with:\)) in your custom `NSView` subclasses.
If your view descends from a class other than `NSView`, call `super` to let the parent view handle any events that you don’t.
