Class
# ARObjectAnchor
An anchor for a real-world 3D object that ARKit detects in the physical environment.
iOS 12.0+iPadOS 12.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+
```
class ARObjectAnchor
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arobjectanchor#overview)
When you run a world-tracking AR session and specify [`ARReferenceObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arreferenceobject) objects for the session configuration’s [`detectionObjects`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arworldtrackingconfiguration/detectionobjects) property, ARKit searches for those objects in the real-world environment. When the session recognizes an object, it automatically adds to its list of anchors an [`ARObjectAnchor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arobjectanchor) for each detected object.
To place virtual 3D content that matches the position or size of the detected object, use the anchor’s inherited [`transform`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/aranchor/transform) property together with the [`center`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arreferenceobject/center) and [`extent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arreferenceobject/extent) of the anchor’s [`referenceObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arobjectanchor/referenceobject).
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arobjectanchor#topics)
### [Identifying Detected Objects](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arobjectanchor#Identifying-Detected-Objects)
[`var referenceObject: ARReferenceObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arobjectanchor/referenceobject)
