## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/debugging-and-reflection#topics)
### [Printing and Dumping](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/debugging-and-reflection#Printing-and-Dumping)
[`func print(Any..., separator: String, terminator: String)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/print\(_:separator:terminator:\))
Writes the textual representations of the given items into the standard output.
[`func print<Target>(Any..., separator: String, terminator: String, to: inout Target)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/print\(_:separator:terminator:to:\))
Writes the textual representations of the given items into the given output stream.
[`func debugPrint(Any..., separator: String, terminator: String)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/debugprint\(_:separator:terminator:\))
Writes the textual representations of the given items most suitable for debugging into the standard output.
[`func debugPrint<Target>(Any..., separator: String, terminator: String, to: inout Target)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/debugprint\(_:separator:terminator:to:\))
Writes the textual representations of the given items most suitable for debugging into the given output stream.
[`func dump<T>(T, name: String?, indent: Int, maxDepth: Int, maxItems: Int) -> T`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/dump\(_:name:indent:maxdepth:maxitems:\))
Dumps the given object’s contents using its mirror to standard output.
[`func dump<T, TargetStream>(T, to: inout TargetStream, name: String?, indent: Int, maxDepth: Int, maxItems: Int) -> T`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/dump\(_:to:name:indent:maxdepth:maxitems:\))
Dumps the given object’s contents using its mirror to the specified output stream.
### [Testing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/debugging-and-reflection#Testing)
[`func assert(@autoclosure () -> Bool, @autoclosure () -> String, file: StaticString, line: UInt)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/assert\(_:_:file:line:\))
Performs a traditional C-style assert with an optional message.
[`func assertionFailure(@autoclosure () -> String, file: StaticString, line: UInt)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/assertionfailure\(_:file:line:\))
Indicates that an internal consistency check failed.
[`func precondition(@autoclosure () -> Bool, @autoclosure () -> String, file: StaticString, line: UInt)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/precondition\(_:_:file:line:\))
Checks a necessary condition for making forward progress.
[`func preconditionFailure(@autoclosure () -> String, file: StaticString, line: UInt) -> Never`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/preconditionfailure\(_:file:line:\))
Indicates that a precondition was violated.
### [Exiting a Program](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/debugging-and-reflection#Exiting-a-Program)
[`func fatalError(@autoclosure () -> String, file: StaticString, line: UInt) -> Never`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/fatalerror\(_:file:line:\))
Unconditionally prints a given message and stops execution.
[`enum Never`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/never)
A type that has no values and can’t be constructed.
### [Querying Runtime Values](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/debugging-and-reflection#Querying-Runtime-Values)
[`struct Mirror`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/mirror)
A representation of the substructure and display style of an instance of any type.
[`struct ObjectIdentifier`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/objectidentifier)

[`func type<T, Metatype>(of: borrowing T) -> Metatype`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/type\(of:\))
Returns the dynamic type of a value.
### [Customizing Your Type’s Reflection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/debugging-and-reflection#Customizing-Your-Types-Reflection)
Provide a custom reflection for your types using these protocols.
[`protocol CustomReflectable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/customreflectable)
A type that explicitly supplies its own mirror.
[`protocol CustomLeafReflectable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/customleafreflectable)
A type that explicitly supplies its own mirror, but whose descendant classes are not represented in the mirror unless they also override `customMirror`.
[`protocol CustomPlaygroundDisplayConvertible`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/customplaygrounddisplayconvertible)
A type that supplies a custom description for playground logging.
[`typealias PlaygroundQuickLook`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/playgroundquicklook)
The sum of types that can be used as a Quick Look representation.
[`macro DebugDescription()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/debugdescription\(\))
Converts description definitions to a debugger Type Summary.
