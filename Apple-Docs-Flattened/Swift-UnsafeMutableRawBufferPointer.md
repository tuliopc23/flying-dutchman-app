## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer#overview)
You can use an `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer` instance in low-level operations to eliminate uniqueness checks and release mode bounds checks. Bounds checks are always performed in debug mode.
An `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer` instance is a view of the raw bytes in a region of memory. Each byte in memory is viewed as a `UInt8` value independent of the type of values held in that memory. Reading from and writing to memory through a raw buffer are untyped operations. Accessing this collection’s bytes does not bind the underlying memory to `UInt8`.
In addition to its collection interface, an `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer` instance also supports the following methods provided by `UnsafeMutableRawPointer`, including bounds checks in debug mode:
  * `load(fromByteOffset:as:)`
  * `loadUnaligned(fromByteOffset:as:)`
  * `storeBytes(of:toByteOffset:as:)`
  * `copyMemory(from:)`


To access the underlying memory through typed operations, the memory must be bound to a trivial type.
Note
A _trivial type_ can be copied bit for bit with no indirection or reference-counting operations. Generally, native Swift types that do not contain strong or weak references or other forms of indirection are trivial, as are imported C structs and enums. Copying memory that contains values of nontrivial types can only be done safely with a typed pointer. Copying bytes directly from nontrivial, in-memory values does not produce valid copies and can only be done by calling a C API, such as `memmove()`.
# [UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer Semantics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer#UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer-Semantics)
An `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer` instance is a view into memory and does not own the memory that it references. Copying a variable or constant of type `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer` does not copy the underlying memory. However, initializing another collection with an `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer` instance copies bytes out of the referenced memory and into the new collection.
The following example uses `someBytes`, an `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer` instance, to demonstrate the difference between assigning a buffer pointer and using a buffer pointer as the source for another collection’s elements. Here, the assignment to `destBytes` creates a new, nonowning buffer pointer covering the first `n` bytes of the memory that `someBytes` references—nothing is copied:
```
var destBytes = someBytes[0..<n]

```

Next, the bytes referenced by `destBytes` are copied into `byteArray`, a new `[UInt8]` array, and then the remainder of `someBytes` is appended to `byteArray`:
```
var byteArray: [UInt8] = Array(destBytes)
byteArray += someBytes[n..<someBytes.count]

```

Assigning into a ranged subscript of an `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer` instance copies bytes into the memory. The next `n` bytes of the memory that `someBytes` references are copied in this code:
```
destBytes[0..<n] = someBytes[n..<(n + n)]

```
