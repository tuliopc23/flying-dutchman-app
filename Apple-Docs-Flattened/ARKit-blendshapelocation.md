## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation#Discussion)
The [`blendShapes`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapes) dictionary provided by an [`ARFaceAnchor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor) object describes the facial expression of a detected face in terms of the movements of specific facial features. For each key in the dictionary, the corresponding value is a floating point number indicating the current position of that feature relative to its neutral configuration, ranging from `0.0` (neutral) to `1.0` (maximum movement).
ARKit provides many blend shape coefficients, resulting in a detailed model of a facial expression; however, you can use as many or as few of the coefficients as you desire to create a visual effect. For example, you might animate a simple cartoon character using only the [`jawOpen`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation/jawopen), [`eyeBlinkLeft`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation/eyeblinkleft), and [`eyeBlinkRight`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation/eyeblinkright) coefficients. A professional 3D artist could create a detailed character model rigged for realistic animation using a larger set, or the entire set, of coefficients.
Note
In the naming of blend shape coefficients, the left and right directions are relative to the face. That is, the [`eyeBlinkRight`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation/eyeblinkright) coefficient refers to the face’s right eye. ARKit views running a face-tracking session mirror the camera image, so the face’s right eye appears on the right side in the view.
