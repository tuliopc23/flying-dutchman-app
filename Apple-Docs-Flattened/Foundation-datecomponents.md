# DateComponents
A date or time specified in terms of units (such as year, month, day, hour, and minute) to be evaluated in a calendar system and time zone.

struct DateComponents
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents#overview)
`DateComponents` encapsulates the components of a date in an extendable, structured manner.
It is used to specify a date by providing the temporal components that make up a date and time in a particular calendar: hour, minutes, seconds, day, month, year, and so on. It can also be used to specify a duration of time, for example, 5 hours and 16 minutes. A `DateComponents` is not required to define all the component fields.
When a new instance of `DateComponents` is created, the date components are set to `nil`.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents#topics)
### [Initializing Date Components](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents#Initializing-Date-Components)

[`func value(for: Calendar.Component) -> Int?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents/value\(for:\))
Returns the value of one of the properties, using an enumeration value instead of a property name.
[`func setValue(Int?, for: Calendar.Component)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents/setvalue\(_:for:\))
Set the value of one of the properties, using an enumeration value instead of a property name.
[`enum Component`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/calendar/component)

### [Using Reference Types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents#Using-Reference-Types)
[`class NSDateComponents`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatecomponents)
An object that specifies a date or time in terms of units (such as year, month, day, hour, and minute) to be evaluated in a calendar system and time zone.
### [Structures](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents#Structures)
[`struct HTTPFormatStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents/httpformatstyle)
Converts `DateComponents` into RFC 9110-compatible “HTTP date” `String`, and parses in the reverse direction. This parser does not do validation on the individual values of the components. An optional date can be created from the result using `Calendar(identifier: .gregorian).date(from: ...)`. When formatting, missing or invalid fields are filled with default values: `Sun`, `01`, `Jan`, `2000`, `00:00:00`, `GMT`. Note that missing fields may result in an invalid date or time. Other values in the `DateComponents` are ignored.
[`struct ISO8601FormatStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents/iso8601formatstyle)
Options for generating and parsing string representations of dates following the ISO 8601 standard.
### [Initializers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents#Initializers)
[`init<T, Value>(Value, strategy: T) throws`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents/init\(_:strategy:\)-62hv8)

### [Instance Properties](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents#Instance-Properties)
[`var dayOfYear: Int?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents/dayofyear)
A day of the year. For example, in the Gregorian calendar, can go from 1 to 365 or 1 to 366 in leap years.
[`var isRepeatedDay: Bool?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents/isrepeatedday)
Set to true if these components represent a repeated day.
