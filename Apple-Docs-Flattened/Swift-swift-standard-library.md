# Swift Standard Library
Solve complex problems and write high-performance, readable code.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/swift-standard-library#Overview)
The Swift standard library defines a base layer of functionality for writing Swift programs, including:
  * Fundamental data types such as [`Int`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/int), [`Double`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/double), and [`String`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string)
  * Common data structures such as [`Array`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array), [`Dictionary`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/dictionary), and [`Set`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/set)
  * Global functions such as [`print(_:separator:terminator:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/print\(_:separator:terminator:\)) and [`abs(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/abs\(_:\))
  * Protocols, such as [`Collection`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/collection) and [`Equatable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/equatable), that describe common abstractions.
  * Protocols, such as [`CustomDebugStringConvertible`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/customdebugstringconvertible) and [`CustomReflectable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/customreflectable), that you use to customize operations that are available to all types.
  * Protocols, such as [`OptionSet`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optionset), that you use to provide implementations that would otherwise require boilerplate code.


Note
Experiment with Swift standard library types and learn high-level concepts using visualizations and practical examples. Learn how the Swift standard library uses protocols and generics to express powerful constraints. Download the playground below to get started.

## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/swift-standard-library#topics)
### [Values and Collections](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/swift-standard-library#Values-and-Collections)
[API Reference Numbers and Basic Values](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/numbers-and-basic-values)
Model data with numbers, Boolean values, and other fundamental types.
[API Reference Strings and Text](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/strings-and-text)
Work with text using Unicode-safe strings.
[API Reference Collections](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/collections)
Store and organize data using arrays, dictionaries, sets, and other data structures.
[API Reference Time](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/time-and-duration)
Measure how long an operation takes and determine schedules in the future.
### [Tools for Your Types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/swift-standard-library#Tools-for-Your-Types)
[API Reference Basic Behaviors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/basic-behaviors)
Use your custom types in operations that depend on testing for equality or order and as members of sets and dictionaries.
[API Reference Encoding, Decoding, and Serialization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/encoding-decoding-and-serialization)
Serialize and deserialize instances of your types with implicit or customized encoding.
[API Reference Initialization with Literals](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/initialization-with-literals)
Allow values of your type to be expressed using different kinds of literals.
### [Programming Tasks](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/swift-standard-library#Programming-Tasks)
[API Reference Input and Output](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/input-and-output)
Print values to the console, read from and write to text streams, and use command line arguments.
[API Reference Debugging and Reflection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/debugging-and-reflection)
Fortify your code with runtime checks, and examine your values’ runtime representation.
[API Reference Macros](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/macros)
Generate boilerplate code and perform other compile-time operations.
[API Reference Concurrency](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/concurrency)
Perform asynchronous and parallel operations.
[API Reference Key-Path Expressions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/key-path-expressions)
Use key-path expressions to access properties dynamically.
[API Reference Manual Memory Management](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/manual-memory-management)
Allocate and manage memory manually.
[API Reference Type Casting and Existential Types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/type-casting-and-existential-types)
Perform casts between types or represent values of any type.
[API Reference C Interoperability](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/c-interoperability)
Use imported C types or call C variadic functions.
[Operator Declarations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/operator-declarations)
Work with prefix, postfix, and infix operators.
