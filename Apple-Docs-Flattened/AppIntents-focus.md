# Focus
Adjust your app’s behavior and filter incoming notifications when the current Focus changes.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppIntents/focus#Overview)
![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/5df0da09dac6ff6a8d59c38d2909275b/focus-filters-hero%402x.png)
People use Focus on macOS, iOS, and iPadOS to minimize distractions. For example, someone might use a Work Focus to hide notifications from personal email or message accounts. When someone engages a Focus, the system executes your app’s custom [`SetFocusFilterIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/setfocusfilterintent). Define a version of this intent to update your app’s configuration and filter incoming notifications.
