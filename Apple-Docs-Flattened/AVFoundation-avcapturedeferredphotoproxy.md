Class
# AVCaptureDeferredPhotoProxy
A lightly-processed photo with data that the system may use to process and fetch a higher-resolution asset at a later time.
iOS 17.0+iPadOS 17.0+
```
class AVCaptureDeferredPhotoProxy
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedeferredphotoproxy#overview)
A photo proxy behaves like a normal [`AVCapturePhoto`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturephoto), and approximates the look of the final rendered image. This object represents intermediate data that the system can render into a final image and ingested into the user’s photo library using the [PhotoKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/PhotoKit) framework. The intermediate data aren’t accessible by the calling process.
