Type Property
# current
A locale representing the user’s region settings at the time the property is read.
iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 8.0+macOS 10.10+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+
```
static var current: [Locale](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale) { get }
```

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/Locale/current#Discussion)
This value represents the locale currently used by the app, based on the following:
  * The current system locale.
  * Any app-specific locale choice made in the Settings app.
  * The availability of the preferred locale in the app. For example, if the person using an app has set their device to use a Spanish-language locale, but the app only supports English, this value returns an English locale.


Use this property when you need to rely on a consistent locale. A locale instance obtained this way does not change even when the person using the device changes language or region settings. If you want a locale instance that always reflects the current configuration, use the one provided by the [`autoupdatingCurrent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale/autoupdatingcurrent) property instead.
To receive notification of locale changes in Swift, add an observer for [`Locale.CurrentLocaleDidChangeMessage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale/currentlocaledidchangemessage). In Objective-C, you can add your object as an observer of [`currentLocaleDidChangeNotification`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslocale/currentlocaledidchangenotification).
