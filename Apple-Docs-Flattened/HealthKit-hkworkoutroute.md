## [ Mentioned in ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutroute#mentions)
[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/reading-route-data)
[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/creating-a-workout-route)
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutroute#overview)
When creating a workout route, you do not instantiate the [`HKWorkoutRoute`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutroute) objects directly. Instead, create a [`HKWorkoutRouteBuilder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutroutebuilder) object, and provide it with location data throughout the workout. After the workout ends, call the route builder’s [`finishRoute(with:metadata:completion:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutroutebuilder/finishroute\(with:metadata:completion:\)) method to create the route. For detailed instructions, see [Creating a workout route](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/creating-a-workout-route).
The route’s location data is stored as an array of [`CLLocation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreLocation/CLLocation) objects. Because the route may contain a large number of location objects, use a [`HKWorkoutRouteQuery`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutroutequery) object to asynchronously read the location data from the HealthKit store in batches. For more information, see [Reading route data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/reading-route-data).
### [Using workout routes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutroute#Using-workout-routes)
Like many HealthKit classes, the [`HKWorkoutRoute`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutroute) class should not be subclassed. You can extend [`HKWorkoutRoute`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutroute) objects by adding custom metadata keys and values to the metadata dictionary when the object is created.
