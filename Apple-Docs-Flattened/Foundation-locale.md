# Locale
Information about linguistic, cultural, and technological conventions for use in formatting data for presentation.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale#overview)
[`Locale`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale) encapsulates information about linguistic, cultural, and technological conventions and standards. Examples of information encapsulated by a locale include the symbol used for the decimal separator in numbers and the formatting conventions for dates and times.
Apps use locales to provide, format, and interpret information about and according to the user’s customs and preferences. Data formatting APIs commonly make use of locales to present data in a locale-appropriate way.
You can create a [`Locale`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale) from a common identifier like `en-US`, or by specifying its components. More commonly, you access the current system locale with the [`current`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale/current) or [`autoupdatingCurrent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale/autoupdatingcurrent) static variables.
### [Working with locale components](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale#Working-with-locale-components)
A [`Locale`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale) exposes its various traits — the appropriate measurement system, currency symbols, date and time conventions, and more — as strongly-typed properties like [`currency`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale/currency-swift.property), `numberingSystem`, and `firstDayOfWeek`.
In addition, the [`language`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale/language-swift.property) property allows you examine traits of languages, through the [`Locale.Language`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale/language-swift.struct) type, in contast with [`NSLocale`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslocale), where [`languageCode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslocale/languagecode) is just a string identifier. You can use a locale’s language to compare whether two locales use the same language, or if one language is a parent of another.
The following example creates a [`Locale`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale) from the identifier `zh-CN`, for Chinese. It then accesses this locale’s [`language`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale/language-swift.property) to get the language’s [`script`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale/language-swift.struct/script), and uses a US English locale to get a localized string describing the script: “Simplified Han”. With the locale `zh-Hant-CN`, for Traditional Chinese, the script would be “Traditional Han” instead.
```
let zhCN = Locale(identifier: "zh-CN")
if let script = zhCN.language.script {
    let enUS = Locale(identifier: "en-US")
    let localizedScript = enUS.localizedString(forScript: script) // "Simplified Han"
}

```

### [Creating custom locales from components](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale#Creating-custom-locales-from-components)
You can create a custom locale by creating a [`Locale`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale) instance from a customized [`Locale.Components`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/locale/components). Do this when you want to tweak specific aspects of a locale. The following example creates a locale that uses language conventions of British English (language region `GB`), but otherwise uses US conventions for things like currency and measurement.
```
var components = Locale.Components(languageCode: "en", languageRegion: "GB")
components.region = Locale.Region("US")
let en_GB_US = Locale(components: components)

```

Creating a custom locale like this isn’t necessarily common in apps, but can be useful in unit testing your app’s localizations.
