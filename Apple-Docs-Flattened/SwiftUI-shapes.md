# Shapes
Trace and fill built-in and custom shapes with a color, gradient, or other pattern.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/shapes#Overview)
Draw shapes like circles and rectangles, as well as custom paths that define shapes of your own design. Apply styles that include environment-aware colors, rich gradients, and material effects to the foreground, background, and outline of your shapes.
![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/b96b0c072d71e44a18d813a1b180ba9b/shapes-hero%402x.png)
If you need the efficiency or flexibility of immediate mode drawing — for example, to create particle effects — use a [`Canvas`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/canvas) view instead.

The inset sizes for the corners of a rectangle.
[`struct ConcentricRectangle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/concentricrectangle)
A shape that is replaced by a concentric version of the current container shape. If the container shape is a rectangle derived shape with four corners, this shape could choose to respect corners individually.
### [Creating circular shapes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/shapes#Creating-circular-shapes)
[`struct Circle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/circle)
A circle centered on the frame of the view containing it.

An ellipse aligned inside the frame of the view containing it.
[`struct Capsule`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/capsule)
A capsule shape aligned inside the frame of the view containing it.
### [Drawing custom shapes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/shapes#Drawing-custom-shapes)

[`func containerShape(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/containershape\(_:\))
Sets the container shape to use for any container relative shape or concentric rectangle within this view.
[`protocol InsettableShape`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/insettableshape)
A shape type that is able to inset itself to produce another shape.
