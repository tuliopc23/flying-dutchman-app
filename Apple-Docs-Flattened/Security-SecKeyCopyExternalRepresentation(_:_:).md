Function
# SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation(_:_:)
Returns an external representation of the given key suitable for the key’s type.
iOS 10.0+iPadOS 10.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.12+tvOS 10.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 3.0+
```
func SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation(
    _ key: [SecKey](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/seckey),
    _ error: [UnsafeMutablePointer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/UnsafeMutablePointer)<[Unmanaged](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Unmanaged)<[CFError](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreFoundation/CFError)>?>?
) -> [CFData](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreFoundation/CFData)?
```

## [ Parameters ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation\(_:_:\)#parameters) 

`key`
    
The key to export. 

`error`
    
The address of a [`CFError`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreFoundation/CFError) object. If an error occurs, this is set to point at an error instance that describes the failure.
## [Return Value](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation\(_:_:\)#return-value)
A data object representing the key in a format suitable for the key type or `NULL` on error. In Objective-C, call the [`CFRelease`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreFoundation/CFRelease) function to free the key’s memory when you are done with it.
## [ Mentioned in ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation\(_:_:\)#mentions)
[](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/storing-keys-as-data)
## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation\(_:_:\)#Discussion)
The operation fails if the key is not exportable, for example if it is bound to a smart card or to the Secure Enclave. It also fails in macOS if the key has the attribute [`kSecKeyExtractable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/kseckeyextractable) set to [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/false).
The method returns data in the PKCS #1 format for an RSA key. For an elliptic curve public key, the format follows the ANSI X9.63 standard using a byte string of `04 || X || Y.` For an elliptic curve private key, the output is formatted as the public key concatenated with the big endian encoding of the secret scalar, or `04 || X || Y || K`. All of these representations use constant size integers, including leading zeros as needed.
