## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/URL#overview)
You can construct URLs and access their parts. For URLs that represent local files, you can also manipulate properties of those files directly, such as changing the file’s last modification date. Finally, you can pass URLs to other APIs to retrieve the contents of those URLs. For example, you can use [`URLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) and its related classes to access the contents of remote resources.
URLs are the preferred way to refer to local files. Most objects that read data from or write data to a file have methods that accept a URL instead of a pathname as the file reference. For example, you can get the contents of a local file URL as [`String`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/String) by calling [`init(contentsOf:encoding:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/String/init\(contentsOf:encoding:\)), or as a [`Data`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/data) by calling [`init(contentsOf:options:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/data/init\(contentsof:options:\)).
As a convenience, you can use Swift’s `async`-`await` syntax to asynchronously access the contents of a [`URL`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url) through the [`resourceBytes`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url/resourcebytes) and [`lines`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url/lines) properties. These properties use the shared [`URLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) instance to load the resource.
`URL` defines a set of properties for common directories like [`documentsDirectory`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url/documentsdirectory) and [`cachesDirectory`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url/cachesdirectory), some of which have distinct behaviors for backup or automatic purging. To make the best use of these directories, see [Using the file system effectively](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/using-the-file-system-effectively).
