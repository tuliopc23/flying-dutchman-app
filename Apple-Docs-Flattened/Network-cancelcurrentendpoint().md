Instance Method
# cancelCurrentEndpoint()
Causes the current endpoint to be rejected, allowing the connection to try another resolved address.

```

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwconnection/cancelcurrentendpoint\(\)#Discussion)
Protocols that do not have handshakes, such as UDP, do not allow connections to validate connectivity on their own. Cancelling an endpoint allows you to indicate that a certain endpoint should be rejected due to a lack of valid response. If other addresses were resolved for the remote endpoint, those will be attempted next.
