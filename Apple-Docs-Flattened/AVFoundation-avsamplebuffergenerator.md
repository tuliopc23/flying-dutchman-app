Class
# AVSampleBufferGenerator
An object that creates sample buffers.
iOS 16.0+iPadOS 16.0+Mac Catalyst 16.0+macOS 10.10+tvOS 16.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 9.0+
```
class AVSampleBufferGenerator
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebuffergenerator#overview)
Each request for `CMSampleBuffer` creation is described in an `AVSampleBufferRequest` object. The [`CMSampleBuffer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreMedia/CMSampleBuffer) opaque objects are returned synchronously. If requested, sample data may be loaded asynchronously (depending on file format support).
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebuffergenerator#topics)
### [Creating sample buffer generators](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebuffergenerator#Creating-sample-buffer-generators)
[`init(asset: AVAsset, timebase: CMTimebase?)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebuffergenerator/init\(asset:timebase:\))
Creates a new sample buffer generator.
### [Creating a sample buffer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebuffergenerator#Creating-a-sample-buffer)
[`func makeSampleBuffer(for: AVSampleBufferRequest) throws -> sending CMSampleBuffer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebuffergenerator/makesamplebuffer\(for:\))
Creates a sample buffer, and attempts to load its data asynchronously if requested.
[`func makeBatch() -> AVSampleBufferGeneratorBatch`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebuffergenerator/makebatch\(\))
Creates a batch object to handle generating multiple sample buffers.
[`func makeSampleBuffer(for: AVSampleBufferRequest, addTo: AVSampleBufferGeneratorBatch) throws -> CMSampleBuffer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebuffergenerator/makesamplebuffer\(for:addto:\))
Creates a sample buffer and attempts to defer I/O for its data.
[`func createSampleBuffer(for: AVSampleBufferRequest) -> CMSampleBuffer?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebuffergenerator/createsamplebuffer\(for:\))
Creates a new sample buffer reference for the specified buffer request.
Deprecated
### [Retrieving sample buffer data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebuffergenerator#Retrieving-sample-buffer-data)
[`class func notifyOfDataReady(for: CMSampleBuffer, completionHandler: (Bool, (any Error)?) -> Void)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebuffergenerator/notifyofdataready\(for:completionhandler:\))
Notifies the sample buffer generator when data is ready for the sample buffer reference or an error has occurred.
