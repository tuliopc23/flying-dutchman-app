## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/barcodeanchor#overview)
A `BarcodeAnchor` describes a barcode that ARKit detects in a person’s surroundings. A barcode anchor has exactly one [`BarcodeSymbology`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Vision/BarcodeSymbology) that indicates which type of barcode the framework detects. It also includes properties, such as the barcode’s payload data, which is a decoded string value of that data.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/barcodeanchor#topics)
### [Getting barcode information](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/barcodeanchor#Getting-barcode-information)
[`var extent: SIMD3<Float>`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/barcodeanchor/extent)
The extent of the detected barcode’s bounds.
[`var originFromAnchorTransform: simd_float4x4`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/barcodeanchor/originfromanchortransform)
The transform from the barcode anchor to the origin coordinate system.
[`var payloadData: Data`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/barcodeanchor/payloaddata)
The encoded payload data of the detected barcode.
[`var payloadString: String?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/barcodeanchor/payloadstring)
The decoded payload string value of the detected barcode.
[`var symbology: BarcodeAnchor.Symbology`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/barcodeanchor/symbology-swift.property)
The symbology of the detected barcode.
[`enum Symbology`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/barcodeanchor/symbology-swift.enum)
Values that describe specific kinds of barcodes.
[`var id: UUID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/barcodeanchor/id)
The unique identifier of an anchor.
