# Documents
Enable people to open and manage documents.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/documents#Overview)
Create a user interface for opening and editing documents using the [`DocumentGroup`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/documentgroup) scene type.
![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/9f0133f6a85bd81cbf87453f28384847/documents-hero%402x.png)
You initialize the scene with a model that describes the organization of the document’s data, and a view hierarchy that SwiftUI uses to display the document’s contents to the user. You can use either a value type model, which you typically store as a structure, that conforms to the [`FileDocument`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/filedocument) protocol, or a reference type model you store in a class instance that conforms to the [`ReferenceFileDocument`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/referencefiledocument) protocol. You can also use SwiftData-backed documents using an initializer like [`init(editing:contentType:editor:prepareDocument:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/documentgroup/init\(editing:contenttype:editor:preparedocument:\)).
SwiftUI supports standard behaviors that users expect from a document-based app, appropriate for each platform, like multiwindow support, open and save panels, drag and drop, and so on. For related design guidance, see [Patterns](https://developer.apple.com/design/Human-Interface-Guidelines/patterns) in the Human Interface Guidelines.
