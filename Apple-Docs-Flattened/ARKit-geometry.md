Instance Property
# geometry
A coarse triangle mesh representing the general shape of the detected plane.

```
var geometry: [ARPlaneGeometry](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arplanegeometry) { get }
```

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arplaneanchor/geometry#Discussion)
This mesh provides vertex, index, and texture coordinate buffers describing the estimated 2D footprint of the plane.
You can visualize the plane geometry by passing these buffers to your preferred rendering engine. To visualize a plane geometry using SceneKit, create an [`ARSCNPlaneGeometry`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arscnplanegeometry) instance and use its [`update(from:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arscnplanegeometry/update\(from:\)) method to update it to match the plane geometry.
