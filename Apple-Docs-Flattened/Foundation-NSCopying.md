Protocol
# NSCopying
A protocol that objects adopt to provide functional copies of themselves.
iOS 2.0+iPadOS 2.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.0+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+
```
protocol NSCopying
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSCopying#overview)
The exact meaning of “copy” can vary from class to class, but a copy must be a functionally independent object with values identical to the original at the time the copy was made. A copy produced with [`NSCopying`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscopying) is implicitly retained by the sender, who is responsible for releasing it.
[`NSCopying`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscopying) declares one method, [`copy(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscopying/copy\(with:\)), but copying is commonly invoked with the convenience method [`copy()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ObjectiveC/NSObject-swift.class/copy\(\)). The [`copy()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ObjectiveC/NSObject-swift.class/copy\(\)) method is defined for all objects inheriting from [`NSObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ObjectiveC/NSObject-swift.class) and simply invokes [`copy(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscopying/copy\(with:\)) with the default zone.
Your options for implementing this protocol are as follows:
  * Implement [`NSCopying`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscopying) using [`alloc`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ObjectiveC/NSObject-swift.class/alloc) and `init...` in classes that don’t inherit [`copy(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscopying/copy\(with:\)).
  * Implement [`NSCopying`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscopying) by invoking the superclass’s [`copy(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscopying/copy\(with:\)) when `NSCopying` behavior is inherited. If the superclass implementation might use the [`NSCopyObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscopyobject) function, make explicit assignments to pointer instance variables for retained objects.
  * Implement [`NSCopying`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscopying) by retaining the original instead of creating a new copy when the class and its contents are immutable.


If a subclass inherits [`NSCopying`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscopying) from its superclass and declares additional instance variables, the subclass has to override [`copy(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscopying/copy\(with:\)) to properly handle its own instance variables, invoking the superclass’s implementation first.
