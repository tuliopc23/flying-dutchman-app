Protocol
# BidirectionalCollection
A collection that supports backward as well as forward traversal.
iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.10+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+
```
protocol BidirectionalCollection<[Element](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/bidirectionalcollection/element)> : [Collection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/collection) where Self.[Indices](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/collection/indices-swift.associatedtype) : [BidirectionalCollection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/bidirectionalcollection), Self.[SubSequence](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/collection/subsequence) : [BidirectionalCollection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/bidirectionalcollection)
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/BidirectionalCollection#overview)
Bidirectional collections offer traversal backward from any valid index, not including a collection’s `startIndex`. Bidirectional collections can therefore offer additional operations, such as a `last` property that provides efficient access to the last element and a `reversed()` method that presents the elements in reverse order. In addition, bidirectional collections have more efficient implementations of some sequence and collection methods, such as `suffix(_:)`.
# [Conforming to the BidirectionalCollection Protocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/BidirectionalCollection#Conforming-to-the-BidirectionalCollection-Protocol)
To add `BidirectionalProtocol` conformance to your custom types, implement the `index(before:)` method in addition to the requirements of the `Collection` protocol.
Indices that are moved forward and backward in a bidirectional collection move by the same amount in each direction. That is, for any valid index `i` into a bidirectional collection `c`:
  * If `i >= c.startIndex && i < c.endIndex`, then `c.index(before: c.index(after: i)) == i`.
  * If `i > c.startIndex && i <= c.endIndex`, then `c.index(after: c.index(before: i)) == i`.


Valid indices are exactly those indices that are reachable from the collection’s `startIndex` by repeated applications of `index(after:)`, up to, and including, the `endIndex`.
