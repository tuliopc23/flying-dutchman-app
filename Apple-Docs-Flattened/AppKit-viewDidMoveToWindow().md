Instance Method
# viewDidMoveToWindow()
Informs the view that it has been added to a new view hierarchy.
macOS
```
@[MainActor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/MainActor)
func viewDidMoveToWindow()
```

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSView/viewDidMoveToWindow\(\)#Discussion)
The default implementation does nothing; subclasses can override this method to perform whatever actions are necessary.
If the view’s [`window`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/window) property is `nil`, that result signifies that the view was removed from its window and does not currently reside in any window.
