Structure
# URLComponents
A structure that parses URLs into and constructs URLs from their constituent parts.
iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 8.0+macOS 10.10+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+
```
struct URLComponents
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents#overview)
This structure parses and constructs URLs according to [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt). Its behavior differs subtly from that of the [`URL`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url) structure, which conforms to older RFCs. However, you can easily obtain a [`URL`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url) value based on the contents of a [`URLComponents`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents) value or vice versa.
## [Topics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents#topics)
### [Creating URL components](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents#Creating-URL-components)
[`init()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/init\(\))
Creates a URL components instance without defining any of the components.
[`init?(string: String)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/init\(string:\))
Creates a URL components instance from a URL string.
[`init?(string: String, encodingInvalidCharacters: Bool)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/init\(string:encodinginvalidcharacters:\))
Creates a URL components instance from the provided string, optionally IDNA- and percent-encoding any invalid characters.
[`init?(url: URL, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: Bool)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/init\(url:resolvingagainstbaseurl:\))
Creates a URL components instance from a URL string, optionally resolving against a base URL.
### [Getting the URL](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents#Getting-the-URL)
[`var url: URL?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/url)
A URL created from the components.
[`func url(relativeTo: URL?) -> URL?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/url\(relativeto:\))
Returns a URL based on the component settings and relative to a given base URL.
[`var string: String?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/string)
A URL derived from the components object, in string form.
### [Accessing components in native format](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents#Accessing-components-in-native-format)
[`var fragment: String?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/fragment)
The fragment subcomponent.
[`var host: String?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/host)
The host subcomponent.
[`var encodedHost: String?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/encodedhost)
The host subcomponent, percent-encoded.
[`var password: String?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/password)
The password subcomponent of the URL.
[`var path: String`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/path)
The path subcomponent.
[`var port: Int?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/port)
The port subcomponent.
[`var query: String?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/query)
The query subcomponent.
[`var queryItems: [URLQueryItem]?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/queryitems)
An array of query items for the URL in the order in which they appear in the original query string.
[`var scheme: String?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/scheme)
The scheme subcomponent of the URL.
[`var user: String?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/user)
The user subcomponent of the URL.
### [Accessing components in URL-encoded format](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents#Accessing-components-in-URL-encoded-format)
[`var percentEncodedFragment: String?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/percentencodedfragment)
The fragment subcomponent, percent-encoded.
[`var percentEncodedHost: String?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/percentencodedhost)
The host subcomponent, percent-encoded.
Deprecated
[`var percentEncodedPassword: String?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/percentencodedpassword)
The password subcomponent, percent-encoded.
[`var percentEncodedPath: String`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/percentencodedpath)

[`struct URLQueryItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlqueryitem)
A single name-value pair from the query portion of a URL.
[`var percentEncodedUser: String?`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents/percentencodeduser)
The user subcomponent, percent-encoded.
### [Locating components in the URL string representation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcomponents#Locating-components-in-the-URL-string-representation)
