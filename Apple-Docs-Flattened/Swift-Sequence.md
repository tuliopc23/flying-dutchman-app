Protocol
# Sequence
A type that provides sequential, iterated access to its elements.
iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.10+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+
```
protocol Sequence<[Element](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence/element)>
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Sequence#overview)
A sequence is a list of values that you can step through one at a time. The most common way to iterate over the elements of a sequence is to use a `for`-`in` loop:
```
let oneTwoThree = 1...3
for number in oneTwoThree {
    print(number)
}
// Prints "1"
// Prints "2"
// Prints "3"

```

While seemingly simple, this capability gives you access to a large number of operations that you can perform on any sequence. As an example, to check whether a sequence includes a particular value, you can test each value sequentially until you’ve found a match or reached the end of the sequence. This example checks to see whether a particular insect is in an array.
```
let bugs = ["Aphid", "Bumblebee", "Cicada", "Damselfly", "Earwig"]
var hasMosquito = false
for bug in bugs {
    if bug == "Mosquito" {
        hasMosquito = true
        break
    }
}
print("'bugs' has a mosquito: \(hasMosquito)")
// Prints "'bugs' has a mosquito: false"

```

The `Sequence` protocol provides default implementations for many common operations that depend on sequential access to a sequence’s values. For clearer, more concise code, the example above could use the array’s `contains(_:)` method, which every sequence inherits from `Sequence`, instead of iterating manually:
```
if bugs.contains("Mosquito") {
    print("Break out the bug spray.")
} else {
    print("Whew, no mosquitos!")
}
// Prints "Whew, no mosquitos!"

```

# [Repeated Access](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Sequence#Repeated-Access)
The `Sequence` protocol makes no requirement on conforming types regarding whether they will be destructively consumed by iteration. As a consequence, don’t assume that multiple `for`-`in` loops on a sequence will either resume iteration or restart from the beginning:
```
for element in sequence {
    if ... some condition { break }
}


for element in sequence {
    // No defined behavior
}

```

In this case, you cannot assume either that a sequence will be consumable and will resume iteration, or that a sequence is a collection and will restart iteration from the first element. A conforming sequence that is not a collection is allowed to produce an arbitrary sequence of elements in the second `for`-`in` loop.
To establish that a type you’ve created supports nondestructive iteration, add conformance to the `Collection` protocol.
# [Conforming to the Sequence Protocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Sequence#Conforming-to-the-Sequence-Protocol)
Making your own custom types conform to `Sequence` enables many useful operations, like `for`-`in` looping and the `contains` method, without much effort. To add `Sequence` conformance to your own custom type, add a `makeIterator()` method that returns an iterator.
Alternatively, if your type can act as its own iterator, implementing the requirements of the `IteratorProtocol` protocol and declaring conformance to both `Sequence` and `IteratorProtocol` are sufficient.
Here’s a definition of a `Countdown` sequence that serves as its own iterator. The `makeIterator()` method is provided as a default implementation.
```
struct Countdown: Sequence, IteratorProtocol {
    var count: Int


    mutating func next() -> Int? {
        if count == 0 {
            return nil
        } else {
            defer { count -= 1 }
            return count
        }
    }
}


let threeToGo = Countdown(count: 3)
for i in threeToGo {
    print(i)
}
// Prints "3"
// Prints "2"
// Prints "1"

```

# [Expected Performance](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Sequence#Expected-Performance)
A sequence should provide its iterator in O(1). The `Sequence` protocol makes no other requirements about element access, so routines that traverse a sequence should be considered O(_n_) unless documented otherwise.
