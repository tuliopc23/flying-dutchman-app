Sample Code
# Making your app’s functionality available to Siri
Add app intent schemas to your app so Siri can complete requests, and integrate your app with Apple Intelligence, Spotlight, and other system experiences.

iOS 26.0+iPadOS 26.0+macOS 26.0+Xcode 26.0+
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/making-your-app-s-functionality-available-to-siri#Overview)
Using this sample app, people can keep track of photos and videos they capture with their device and can use Siri to access app functionality. To make its main functionality available to Siri, the app uses the App Intents framework.

### [Make app functionality available to Siri](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/making-your-app-s-functionality-available-to-siri#Make-app-functionality-available-to-Siri)
This sample uses [App intent domains](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/app-intent-domains) to make the [`AppEnum`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/appenum), [`AppEntity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/appentity), and [`AppIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/appintent) implementations available to Siri as shown in the following example:
```
@AppEnum(schema: .photos.assetType)
enum AssetType: String, AppEnum {
    case photo
    case video


    static let caseDisplayRepresentations: [AssetType : DisplayRepresentation]  = [
        .photo: "Photo",
        .video: "Video"
    ]
}

```

### [Make data available in Spotlight](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/making-your-app-s-functionality-available-to-siri#Make-data-available-in-Spotlight)
People can use Spotlight to search for data the sample contains. To enable this functionality, the sample defines an app entity that conforms to [`IndexedEntity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppIntents/IndexedEntity):
```
@AppEntity(schema: .photos.asset)
struct AssetEntity: IndexedEntity {


    // MARK: Static


    static let defaultQuery = AssetQuery()


    // MARK: Properties


    let id: String
    let asset: Asset


    @Property(title: "Title")
    var title: String?


    var creationDate: Date?
    var location: CLPlacemark?
    var assetType: AssetType?
    var isFavorite: Bool
    var isHidden: Bool
    var hasSuggestedEdits: Bool


    var displayRepresentation: DisplayRepresentation {
        DisplayRepresentation(
            title: title.map { "\($0)" } ?? "Unknown",
            subtitle: assetType?.localizedStringResource ?? "Photo"
        )
    }
}

```

### [Make app entities shareable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/making-your-app-s-functionality-available-to-siri#Make-app-entities-shareable)
By adopting the [`Transferable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreTransferable/Transferable) protocol, this sample makes the data it describes as app entities more shareable and allows other apps to understand its data formats. For example, the sample’s `AssetEntity` implements `Transferable` to make it easy to share a photo as a PNG image with Siri or the share sheet:
```
extension AssetEntity: Transferable {


    struct AssetQuery: EntityQuery {
        @Dependency
        var library: MediaLibrary


        @MainActor
        func entities(for identifiers: [AssetEntity.ID]) async throws -> [AssetEntity] {
            library.assets(for: identifiers).map(\.entity)
        }


        @MainActor
        func suggestedEntities() async throws -> [AssetEntity] {
            // Suggest the first three assets in the photo library.
            library.assets.prefix(3).map(\.entity)
        }
    }


    static var transferRepresentation: some TransferRepresentation {
        DataRepresentation(exportedContentType: .png) { entity in
            try await entity.asset.pngData()
        }
    }
}

```

### [Make onscreen content available to Siri and Apple Intelligence](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/making-your-app-s-functionality-available-to-siri#Make-onscreen-content-available-to-Siri-and-Apple-Intelligence)
When the user asks a question about onscreen content or wants to perform an action on it, Siri and Apple Intelligence can retrieve the content to respond to the question and perform the action. If the user explicitly requests it, Siri and Apple Intelligence can send content to supported third-party services. For example, someone could view a photo and use Siri to describe things a person can do with an identified object in the photo by saying or typing a phrase like “Hey Siri, what can I do with the object in this photo?” To integrate onscreen content with current and upcoming personal intelligence features of Siri and Apple Intelligence, the sample’s `AssetEntity` conforms to the [`Transferable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreTransferable/Transferable) protocol and the `.photos.asset` schema. When a person views a photo, the app associates the asset entity with an [`NSUserActivity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSUserActivity) to make the photo available to Siri and Apple Intelligence:
```
var body: some View {
    // ...
    MediaView(
        image: image,
        duration: asset.duration,
        isFavorite: asset.isFavorite,
        proxy: proxy
    )
    .userActivity(
        "com.example.apple-samplecode.AssistantSchemasExample.ViewingPhoto",
        element: asset.entity
    ) { asset, activity in
        activity.title = "Viewing a photo"
        activity.appEntityIdentifier = EntityIdentifier(for: asset)
    }
    // ...

```
