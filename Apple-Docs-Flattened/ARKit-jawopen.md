## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation/jawopen#Discussion)
The figure below shows a face geometry (see [`ARSCNFaceGeometry`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arscnfacegeometry)) in two states, demonstrating values of `0.0` and `1.0` for this coefficient. In both states, the values for all other [`ARFaceAnchor.BlendShapeLocation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation) coefficients are set to `0.0`.
