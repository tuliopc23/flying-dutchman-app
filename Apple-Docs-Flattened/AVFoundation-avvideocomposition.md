# AVVideoComposition
An object that describes how to compose video frames at particular points in time.
iOS 4.0+iPadOS 4.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.7+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+
```
class AVVideoComposition
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avvideocomposition#overview)
If you use the built-in video compositor, the instructions a video composition contain can specify a spatial transformation, an opacity value, and a cropping rectangle for each video source. This values can vary over time by applying linear ramping functions.
You can create a custom video compositor by implementing the [`AVVideoCompositing`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avvideocompositing) protocol. The system provides the custom video compositor with pixel buffers for each of its video sources during playback, and can perform arbitrary graphical operations on them to produce visual output.
