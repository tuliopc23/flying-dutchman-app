# Testing win-back offers in Xcode
Validate your app’s handling of win-back offers that you configure for the testing environment.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/testing-win-back-offers-in-xcode#overview)
A win-back offer is an offer for a discount on an auto-renewable subscription to a customer who was previously subscribed.
To test win-back offers in Xcode, first set up your StoreKit configuration file with auto-renewable subscriptions and win-back offers. Subscribe to an auto-renewable subscription with one or more win-back offers. Then, cancel the subscription and allow it to expire. If the win-back offer’s setting is Eligible, the testing system makes the win-back offer available to redeem immediately after the subscription expires.
Testing win-back offers in Xcode is convenient early in the development process, because it doesn’t rely on any product configurations in App Store Connect. However, you can also test win-back offers in the sandbox environment, which does rely on your App Store Connect configuration. For more information, see [Testing win-back offers in the sandbox environment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/testing-win-back-offers-in-the-sandbox-environment).
### [Perform basic setup](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/testing-win-back-offers-in-xcode#Perform-basic-setup)
Before you can begin testing in Xcode, complete the steps in [Setting up StoreKit Testing in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode), including creating a StoreKit configuration file and enabling StoreKit testing in Xcode.
### [Configure win-back offers for testing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/testing-win-back-offers-in-xcode#Configure-win-back-offers-for-testing)
Start by opening the StoreKit configuration editor in Xcode and defining at least one auto-renewable subscription and subscription group. Then follow these steps to configure one or more win-back offers:
  1. In the left pane, select the subscription under the Auto-Renewable Subscriptions heading.
  2. Under the Win-back Offers heading in the editor, click the Add button (+) to configure a new offer by filling out the offer details as follows, and then clicking Save.



Reference name
    
A name to identify the offer in the StoreKit configuration. 

Offer identifier
    
An offer ID that’s unique within the subscription group. 

Offer type
    
The payment mode of the offer. For more information, see [`Product.SubscriptionOffer.PaymentMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/subscriptionoffer/paymentmode-swift.struct). 

Duration
    
The total duration of the offer. The offer’s renewal period matches the subscription’s renewal period. 

Price
    
The price, in the same currency as the subscription, for offers that aren’t free. 

Eligiblity
    
Determines whether the system considers the customer eligible for the win-back offer in the test environment. Select Eligible or Not Eligible.
Note
The eligibility criteria that determine whether a customer can redeem a win-back offer can have many rules and states. Rather than requiring you to construct all the conditions before you can test win-back offers in your app, the testing UI provides a simplified Eligible or Not Eligible setting that bypasses any other eligibility criteria. Set the value to Eligible to test your app’s response when a customer receives a win-back offer.
### [Run the test](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/testing-win-back-offers-in-xcode#Run-the-test)
To display a win-back offer, run your app in the Xcode environment and follow these steps:
  1. In your app, subscribe to an auto-renewable subscription that has at least one win-back offer.
  2. In the StoreKit configuration, set the Eligibility setting for the win-back offer to Eligible.
  3. Cancel the subscription. If your app implements subscription management, such as by calling [`showManageSubscriptions(in:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/appstore/showmanagesubscriptions\(in:\)), cancel the subscription through your app. Otherwise, use the transaction manager in Xcode by choosing Debug > StoreKit > Manage Transactions, selecting the subscription transaction, and turning off the auto-renew option.
  4. Wait for the canceled subscription to expire. The system makes the win-back offer available to redeem as soon as the subscription expires.
  5. In your app, open your store. Examine your app’s implementation of the win-back offer. For example, if your app uses [StoreKit views](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/storekit-views), the eligible offers appear automatically when your app displays a [`SubscriptionStoreView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/subscriptionstoreview).


For more information about using the transaction manager, see [Testing in-app purchases with StoreKit transaction manager in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/testing-in-app-purchases-with-storeKit-transaction-manager-in-code).
### [Reset or rerun the test](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/testing-win-back-offers-in-xcode#Reset-or-rerun-the-test)
You can rerun the test without resetting any state values. Win-back offers that you set to be Eligible appear as soon as their related subscriptions expire.
