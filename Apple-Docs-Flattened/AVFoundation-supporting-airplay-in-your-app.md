# Supporting AirPlay in your app
Set up your app to use AirPlay to send content wirelessly.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/supporting-airplay-in-your-app#overview)
AirPlay enables you to send content wirelessly from an Apple device to an Apple TV or AirPlay-enabled speaker. AirPlay provides enhanced support for wireless audio distribution, including the ability to send content to multiple AirPlay-enabled speakers.
### [Identify the audio type the app plays](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/supporting-airplay-in-your-app#Identify-the-audio-type-the-app-plays)
In iOS, tvOS, and watchOS, set your audio session’s route-sharing policy to `.longForm`. Long-form audio is anything other than system sounds, such as music, audiobooks, or podcasts. This setting identifies the audio that an app plays, such as in the following example.
```
let audioSession = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
try audioSession.setCategory(.playback, 
                             mode: .default, 
                             policy: .longFormAudio)

```

### [Add an AirPlay picker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/supporting-airplay-in-your-app#Add-an-AirPlay-picker)
Add [`AVRoutePickerView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVKit/AVRoutePickerView) to your view hierarchy to include an AirPlay picker in your app. The picker provides users with a list of potential AirPlay devices they can use with your app. To control when to show the picker, use [`AVRouteDetector`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avroutedetector) to identify the state of the route detector.
### [Add a media player](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/supporting-airplay-in-your-app#Add-a-media-player)
Use APIs to customize your AirPlay adoption with Media Player integration. If you use [`MPRemoteCommandCenter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MediaPlayer/MPRemoteCommandCenter), you can receive remote commands. If you use [`MPNowPlayingInfoCenter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MediaPlayer/MPNowPlayingInfoCenter), you can inform the system metadata about the track that’s playing on the device.
### [Configure an app for fast streaming](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/supporting-airplay-in-your-app#Configure-an-app-for-fast-streaming)
Adopt one of two playback API sets that take advantage of the enhanced buffering in AirPlay:
  * For simple enhanced buffering, use [`AVPlayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayer) or [`AVQueuePlayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avqueueplayer). This works well for video content. For more information, see [Implementing simple enhanced buffering for your content](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/implementing-simple-enhanced-buffering-for-your-content).
  * For more flexibility with enhanced buffering, use [`AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebufferaudiorenderer) and [`AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebufferrendersynchronizer). This option is better for apps that require control over I/O, perform preprocessing on their media data, or have a DRM model that [`AVPlayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayer) doesn’t support. For more information, see [Implementing flexible enhanced buffering for your content](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/implementing-flexible-enhanced-buffering-for-your-content).
