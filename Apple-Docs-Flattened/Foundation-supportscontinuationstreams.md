Instance Property
# supportsContinuationStreams
A Boolean value that determines whether the continuing app can request streams to be opened back to the originating app.
iOS 8.0+iPadOS 8.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.10+tvOS 9.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 2.0+
```
var supportsContinuationStreams: [Bool](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Bool) { get set }
```

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity/supportscontinuationstreams#Discussion)
If the value of this property is [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/true), the continuing app can connect back to the originating app for more information using streams. The default value of this property is [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/false). It can dynamically be set to [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/true) to selectively support continuation streams based on the state of the user activity.
