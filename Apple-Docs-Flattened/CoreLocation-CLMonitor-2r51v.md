### [Accessing the location monitor’s identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreLocation/CLMonitor-2r51v#Accessing-the-location-monitors-identifiers)
[`var identifiers: [String]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clmonitor-2r51v/identifiers)
An array that contains the identifiers of the conditions the framework is monitoring.
### [Accessing the monitor’s events](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreLocation/CLMonitor-2r51v#Accessing-the-monitors-events)
[`let events: CLMonitor.Events`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clmonitor-2r51v/events-swift.property)
An asynchronous sequence of events that represent the conditions the monitor object observes.
### [Monitor conditions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreLocation/CLMonitor-2r51v#Monitor-conditions)
[`struct BeaconIdentityCondition`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clmonitor-2r51v/beaconidentitycondition)
A condition that describes the characteristics of a beacon.
[`struct CircularGeographicCondition`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clmonitor-2r51v/circulargeographiccondition)
A condition that describes a circular geographic area that a center point and radius define.
### [Monitor events](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreLocation/CLMonitor-2r51v#Monitor-events)
[`struct Event`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clmonitor-2r51v/event)
An event object that the framework passes to the events sequence in the monitor.
[`struct Record`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clmonitor-2r51v/record)
A structure that represents a condition and its associated event information that the framework is monitoring.
[`struct Events`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clmonitor-2r51v/events-swift.struct)
