Class
# AVCaptureMultiCamSession
A capture session that supports simultaneous capture from multiple inputs of the same media type.
iOS 13.0+iPadOS 13.0+Mac Catalyst 14.0+tvOS 17.0+visionOS 2.1+
```
class AVCaptureMultiCamSession
```

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturemulticamsession#overview)
The session preset for a multicamera session is always [`inputPriority`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturesession/preset/inputpriority). Set each capture device’s [`activeFormat`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice/activeformat) value to the desired quality of service.
You can dynamically enable and disable this session’s individual camera inputs without interrupting capture preview. To stop an individual camera, disable all of its connections or connected ports. The camera then stops streaming data to save power and bandwidth. Other inputs that are streaming data through the session are unaffected.
Note
If your app only needs to capture from a single camera at a time, use [`AVCaptureSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturesession) instead.
