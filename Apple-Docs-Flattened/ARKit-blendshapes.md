Instance Property
# blendShapes
A dictionary of named coefficients representing the detected facial expression in terms of the movement of specific facial features.
iOS 11.0+iPadOS 11.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+
```
var blendShapes: [[ARFaceAnchor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor).[BlendShapeLocation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation) : [NSNumber](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSNumber)] { get }
```

## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapes#Discussion)
Each key in this dictionary (an [`ARFaceAnchor.BlendShapeLocation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation) constant) represents one of many specific facial features recognized by ARKit. The corresponding value for each key is a floating point number indicating the current position of that feature relative to its neutral configuration, ranging from `0.0` (neutral) to `1.0` (maximum movement).
You can use blend shape coefficients to animate a 2D or 3D character in ways that follow the user’s facial expressions. ARKit provides many blend shape coefficients, resulting in a detailed model of a facial expression; however, you can use as many or as few of the coefficients as you desire to create a visual effect. For example, you might animate a simple cartoon character using only the [`jawOpen`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation/jawopen), [`eyeBlinkLeft`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation/eyeblinkleft), and [`eyeBlinkRight`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation/eyeblinkright) coefficients. A professional 3D artist could create a detailed character model rigged for realistic animation using a larger set, or the entire set, of coefficients.
You can also use blend shape coefficients to record a specific facial expression and reuse it later. The [`ARFaceGeometry`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfacegeometry) [`init(blendShapes:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arfacegeometry/init\(blendshapes:\)) initializer creates a detailed 3D mesh from a dictionary equivalent to this property’s value; the serialized form of a blend shapes dictionary is more portable than that of the face mesh those coefficients describe.
