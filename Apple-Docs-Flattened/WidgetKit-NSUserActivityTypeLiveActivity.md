## [Discussion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/WidgetKit/NSUserActivityTypeLiveActivity#discussion)
In many cases, you use [`widgetURL(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/widgetURL\(_:\)) to allow users to tap a Live Activity and open a screen in the app with functionality that best fits the Live Activity. If you don’t use the `widgetURL(_:)` modifier to provide a URL, the system launches your app and passes `NSUserActivityTypeLiveActivity` as the [`activityType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSUserActivity/activityType) of [`NSUserActivity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSUserActivity) upon launch. Check for this value on launch to open a screen in your app that fits the context of the active Live Activity.
